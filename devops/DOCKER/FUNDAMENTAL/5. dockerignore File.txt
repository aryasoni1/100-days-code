### 📁 **`.dockerignore` File**

The `.dockerignore` file works like `.gitignore` — it tells Docker which files/folders to **exclude** when building your image. This speeds up the build and keeps images clean and secure.

---

### ✅ **Why Use `.dockerignore`?**

* Prevent sending unnecessary files to the Docker daemon.
* Reduce image size and build context time.
* Avoid leaking sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, SSH keys).

---

### 📌 **Common `.dockerignore` Entries**

```dockerignore
# Node.js
node_modules
npm-debug.log

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# React/Next.js
.next
dist
build

# General
.env
*.log
.git
.DS_Store
docker-compose.override.yml
```

---

### 🧠 **How It Works**

When you run:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
```

Docker sends the **build context** (your project files) to the Docker daemon — and `.dockerignore` reduces that payload.

---

### ⚠️ Pro Tip

If `node_modules` is included during Docker build, it can:

* Break cross-platform compatibility.
* Increase image size dramatically.

So: **Always ignore it** and install dependencies in the container.
