### 🧱 **Docker Images & Layers**

Docker images are built in **layers**, where each command in a `Dockerfile` (like `RUN`, `COPY`, `ENV`) creates a **new layer**. These layers are **cached**, reused, and shared between containers to optimize speed and storage.

---

### 🔄 **Image Caching**

* Docker caches each layer during build.
* If a layer hasn’t changed, Docker reuses the cache to **speed up builds**.

#### Example:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18

COPY package.json .         # Layer 1
RUN npm install             # Layer 2 (cached if package.json unchanged)
COPY . .                    # Layer 3
RUN npm run build           # Layer 4
```

Changing `package.json` will invalidate the cache for `npm install` and all layers below.

---

### 🏗️ **Multi-Stage Builds**

Use **multi-stage builds** to:

* Separate build environment from runtime.
* Keep the final image small and production-ready.

#### Example:

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM node:18-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json .
RUN npm install --production
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

🔹 Benefits:

* Only includes what's needed for production.
* Avoids shipping dev dependencies, source files, etc.

---

### ⚡ Pro Tips:

* Order `Dockerfile` instructions from least to most frequently changing for better cache use.
* Use `.dockerignore` to reduce unnecessary context and further optimize.
