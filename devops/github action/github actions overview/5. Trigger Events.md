# 🚀 **7. Trigger Events in GitHub Actions**

---

GitHub Actions workflows are triggered by **events** like code pushes, PRs, scheduled tasks, and manual runs.

---

## 🔔 **Common Trigger Events**

| Event               | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `push`              | Runs on every push to a branch          |
| `pull_request`      | Triggers when a PR is opened or updated |
| `schedule`          | Runs on a cron schedule                 |
| `release`           | Fires on new releases or pre-releases   |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual trigger via GitHub UI            |

## ✅ **Filter by Branch/Tag**

You can specify which branches or tags should trigger a workflow.

### 📁 Example: Run on push to `main` or `dev`

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
```

### 📁 Example: Only run on specific tags

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'  # e.g., v1.0.0
```

---

## ⏰ **Scheduled Workflows (CRON)**

Runs on a time schedule (UTC timezone):

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Every day at midnight
```

---

## 🖐️ **Manual Triggers**

Allow triggering workflows manually from GitHub UI:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```
