# 🛠️ **Build Backend**

---

In CI/CD pipelines, backend apps need to be **compiled**, **packaged**, or **containerized** before deployment.

---

## 🔧 **Java (Spring Boot)**

### ▶️ Build with Maven:

```yaml
- name: Build with Maven
  run: mvn clean package
```

* Generates a `.jar` file in the `target/` directory.
* Often followed by running or deploying this JAR.

```yaml
- name: Run Spring Boot
  run: java -jar target/app-name.jar
```

---

## 🐍 **Python (Flask / Django)**

* Python apps don’t require compiling, but you can still build Docker images or packages.

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🐳 **Dockerized Backend**

If you're using Docker:

```yaml
- name: Build Docker Image
  run: docker build -t your-backend-app .
```

```yaml
- name: Push Docker Image
  run: docker push your-docker-repo/your-backend-app
```

## ✅ **Other Backend Tools**

| Language/Framework | Build Command              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Node.js (Express)  | `npm run build` (optional) |
| Go                 | `go build`                 |
| .NET               | `dotnet build`             |

## 🔐 Tip: Use Secrets for Environment Access

```yaml
env:
  DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
```
