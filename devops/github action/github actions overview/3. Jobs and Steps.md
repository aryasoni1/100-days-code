Here's the `.md` formatted beginner-friendly note for **Jobs and Steps** in GitHub Actions:

# 🧩 **5. Jobs and Steps in GitHub Actions**

---

## ⚙️ `jobs:` – Units of Work

* A **job** is a set of **steps** that run in the same runner (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows).
* Multiple jobs can run in **parallel** by default or be **sequenced** using `needs:`.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Steps go here
```

---

## 🧱 `steps:` – Task Instructions

* Each job contains **steps**, which can:

  * Run shell commands
  * Use prebuilt actions (like `checkout`, `setup-node`, etc.)

### ✅ Basic Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

## 🧠 Key Notes:

| Element    | Purpose                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `jobs:`    | Define different stages or logical groupings         |
| `runs-on:` | Define the OS for the runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`) |
| `steps:`   | Commands or actions to perform tasks                 |
| `uses:`    | Run a GitHub Action                                  |
| `run:`     | Execute shell command                                |

---

## 🔁 Sequential Jobs with `needs`

You can run jobs in order using `needs:`:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Build step"

  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Test after build"
```
