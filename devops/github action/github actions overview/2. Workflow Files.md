## üìÅ **4. Workflow Files**

GitHub Actions uses **YAML** files to define CI/CD workflows. These files live inside:

```
.github/workflows/
```

Example: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

## üî§ **YAML Syntax**

> YAML is indentation-sensitive ‚Äî use **2 spaces**, not tabs!

* Lists start with `-`
* Key-value pairs use `key: value` format

Example:

```yaml
name: Example Workflow
on: push
```

---

## üßæ **Workflow File Structure**

### üîñ `name:`

Gives the workflow a readable name (shows up in GitHub UI)

```yaml
name: Node.js CI
```

---

### üö® `on:`

Specifies when the workflow should run.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch: # manual trigger
```

Common triggers:

| Trigger             | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `push`              | On every push                      |
| `pull_request`      | On PR creation/update              |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual button in GitHub UI         |
| `schedule`          | Run on cron (e.g., nightly builds) |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è `jobs:`

Defines the jobs that will run (e.g., test, build, deploy)

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

---

### üß± `steps:`

Each step runs a command or uses an action:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup Node
    uses: actions/setup-node@v3

  - name: Install deps
    run: npm install
```

---

| Component   | Purpose                                 |

| `name:`     | Workflow label                          |
| `on:`       | Trigger (push, PR, manual, cron)        |
| `jobs:`     | Set of tasks to execute                 |
| `steps:`    | Individual commands or reusable actions |
