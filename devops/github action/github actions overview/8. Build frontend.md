Here's your `.md` formatted note for **Build and Deploy**:

---

# 🚀 **10. Build and Deploy**

---

CI/CD pipelines often include **building** the application and **deploying** it to a server or hosting platform.

---

## 🧱 **Build Frontend**

Use your frontend framework’s build command to compile production-ready assets.

### 📦 Example (React, Vue, Next.js):

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install

- name: Build project
  run: npm run build
```

> 🔹 `npm run build` typically compiles/minifies code and generates a `dist/` or `.next/` folder depending on the framework.

---

## 🚚 **Deploy**

After a successful build, deploy using one of the following:

### ✅ **Vercel / Netlify (auto via GitHub)**

* Auto-deploy on push to main branch.
* No need for custom GitHub Actions unless customizing build.

### ✅ **Static Hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages)**

Use `actions/deploy-pages` or similar:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./build
```

### ✅ **Custom Server / VPS**

Use SSH or SCP to upload and restart:

```yaml
- name: Deploy via SCP
  run: scp -r ./build user@your-server:/var/www/html
```

### ✅ **Docker-Based Deployment**

```yaml
- name: Build Docker Image
  run: docker build -t your-app .

- name: Push to Docker Hub
  run: docker push your-app
```

---

## 🔐 **Use Secrets for Security**

Use `secrets` in GitHub to store SSH keys, tokens, and credentials.

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

Let me know if you'd like examples for Heroku, Render, Railway, or container orchestration (like Kubernetes)!
