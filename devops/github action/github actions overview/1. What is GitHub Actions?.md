# ⚙️ **3. GitHub Actions Overview**

---

## 🚀 What is GitHub Actions?

> GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform built into GitHub**
> Automate tasks like **testing**, **building**, and **deploying** your code directly from your repository.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

* **Trigger on events** (e.g., push, pull request, release)
* Define **workflows** in `.yaml` files
* Run jobs on **Linux, Windows, or macOS**
* Easily integrate with **third-party actions** (like Docker, AWS, Vercel)

---

## 📁 File Location

All workflow files live in:

```
.github/workflows/
```

Example: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

---

## 🧾 Sample GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

## 🔑 Concepts

| Term         | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Workflow** | The entire automation pipeline             |
| **Job**      | A set of steps that run in one environment |
| **Step**     | A single task (e.g., install deps)         |
| **Action**   | A reusable package for specific tasks      |

---

## ✅ Use Cases

* Run tests on every push
* Deploy frontend to Vercel or Netlify
* Build Docker containers and push to Docker Hub
* Lint code and check formatting

---

## 🔐 Secrets & Security

* Store sensitive data (API keys, tokens) in:

  * **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Access in workflow via:

```yaml
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Keep workflows **short and modular**
* Use **caching** to speed up installs (e.g., `actions/cache`)
* Run jobs **in parallel** to speed up pipelines
* Use **status badges** to display CI status in README
