Absolutely! Here's your breakdown of:

---

# ðŸ“£ **15. Notifications and Monitoring in GitHub Actions**

Keep your team informed about build/test/deploy statuses in real-time and selectively notify using conditional logic.

---

## ðŸ“² **1. Integrate with Slack, Discord, or Email**

### âœ… **Slack**

Use the [`slackapi/slack-github-action`](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-github-action):

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.24.0
  with:
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "âœ… Deployment succeeded on `${{ github.ref_name }}`!"
      }
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

> ðŸ”’ Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK` in **GitHub Secrets**.

---

### âœ… **Discord**

Use a webhook with a basic `curl` command:

```yaml
- name: Notify Discord
  run: curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content":"âœ… CI Passed for ${{ github.repository }}"}' ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
```

---

### âœ… **Email**

Use [third-party actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/send-email) or external tools like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Gmail SMTP.

Example using `dawidd6/action-send-mail`:

```yaml
- name: Send Email
  uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
  with:
    server_address: smtp.example.com
    server_port: 587
    username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USER }}
    password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASS }}
    subject: "CI/CD Status"
    body: "Build completed for commit ${{ github.sha }}"
    to: you@example.com
    from: CI Bot
```

---

## ðŸ§  **2. Use `if:` Conditionals for Step Control**

Only send notifications on **failure** or **success**:

```yaml
- name: Notify on Failure
  if: failure()
  run: echo "Something went wrong!" 
```

```yaml
- name: Notify on Success
  if: success()
  run: echo "All good!"
```

---

### ðŸš¨ Common Conditional Checks:

* `success()` â€“ step/job succeeded
* `failure()` â€“ step/job failed
* `always()` â€“ run no matter what
* `cancelled()` â€“ if job was cancelled

---

### âœ… Summary

| Notification Tool    | How                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Slack                | Use Slack Webhook with `slackapi`  |
| Discord              | Use `curl` and webhook             |
| Email                | Use SMTP with an action            |
| Conditional Triggers | Use `if:` for status-based control |
