## 🚀 **ServiceConnect: Project Roadmap**

### 🗂️ Phase 1: Planning & Architecture (Week 1)

#### ✅ Define Requirements

* Service provider directory with categories (e.g., plumber, electrician)
* Real-time booking & chat system
* User auth (Customers & Providers)
* Admin portal (optional for future)
* Responsive UI

#### ✅ Deliverables

* 📄 Feature Spec: Notion/Google Docs
* 🧠 Architecture Diagram: Excalidraw/draw\.io

  * User → Frontend (Next.js) → API (Node.js + Express) → DB (MongoDB)
  * Real-time: Socket.io + Redis Pub/Sub
  * Dockerized microservices

---

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Environment & Repo Setup (Week 2)

#### ✅ Tasks

* Set up GitHub repo: `serviceconnect`
* Folder Structure:

  ```
  serviceconnect/
  ├── frontend/ (Next.js)
  ├── backend/ (Express.js + Socket.io)
  ├── shared/ (constants, types, utils)
  ├── docker-compose.yml
  └── .github/workflows/ (CI/CD)
  ```
* Configure Docker for local dev
* Connect MongoDB & Redis with Docker
* Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions

---

### 🔧 Phase 3: Backend APIs & DB Schema (Week 3)

#### ✅ Tasks

* MongoDB schema:

  * Users (role: 'customer' | 'provider')
  * Services (type, category, price)
  * Bookings (status, timestamps)
  * Messages (Socket.io chat)
* Express.js REST APIs:

  * Auth (JWT + bcrypt)
  * Service listing & filtering
  * Booking create/update/cancel
* Redis:

  * Store sessions & pub/sub for booking/chat

---

### 💻 Phase 4: Frontend Development (Week 4–5)

#### ✅ Tasks

* Build pages with Next.js:

  * Home, Service categories, Provider profile
  * Auth (Login/Register)
  * Booking workflow (date/time selection)
  * Chat UI (WebSocket)
* Tailwind CSS + micro-interactions
* Role-based navigation (Customer/Provider)

---

### ⚙️ Phase 5: Real-Time Booking & Messaging (Week 6)

#### ✅ Tasks

* Implement Socket.io client & server
* Redis Pub/Sub for multi-instance scaling
* Booking status sync across devices
* Chat interface with live message delivery
* Conflict handling & locking logic

---

### 📊 Phase 6: Metrics & Optimization (Week 7)

#### ✅ Tasks

* Lazy load provider cards
* Pagination & filters
* Lighthouse audits: TTI < 1.5s
* Redis caching for provider search
* Protect all critical APIs with auth middleware

---

### 🚢 Phase 7: Deployment & Testing (Week 8)

#### ✅ Tasks

* Dockerize all services
* Deploy to Vercel (frontend) + Render/AWS (backend)
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions for testing & Docker build
* Monitor with uptime checks, logs (optional: use LogRocket, Sentry)

Would you like:

* A prebuilt GitHub repo template with this structure?
* Sample Docker, MongoDB, Redis, and Socket.io starter config files?
* UI wireframes and Figma design based on your features?

Let me know, and I’ll generate them for you.
