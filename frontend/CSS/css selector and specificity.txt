CSS Selectors Overview
CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. There are five main types:
	1. Basic Selectors:
		○ Universal Selector (*): Applies styles to all elements.
		○ Element Selector: Targets elements by their tag name (e.g., p for paragraphs).
		○ Class Selector (.className): Styles elements with a specific class.
		○ ID Selector (#idName): Styles a single element with a unique ID.
	2. Combinator Selectors:
		○ Descendant Selector: Targets elements inside another element.
		○ Child Selector (>): Styles direct child elements.
		○ Adjacent Sibling Selector (+): Styles the element immediately following another.
		○ General Sibling Selector (~): Styles all siblings following a specific element.
	3. Attribute Selectors:
		○ Presence Selector: Targets elements with a specific attribute.
		○ Attribute Value Selector: Matches elements with a specific attribute value.
		○ Substring Matching: Matches elements where the attribute contains a substring.
	4. Pseudo-Classes:
		○ :hover: Styles elements when hovered over.
		○ :focus: Styles elements when focused.
		○ :first-child: Styles the first child of a parent.
		○ :last-child: Styles the last child of a parent.
		○ :not: Excludes elements from styling.
	5. Pseudo-Elements:
		○ ::before: Inserts content before an element.
		○ ::after: Inserts content after an element.
		○ ::first-line: Styles the first line of text.
		○ ::first-letter: Styles the first letter of text.
		○ ::placeholder: Styles the placeholder text of input fields.
This page provides a comprehensive guide to CSS selectors, explaining their usage and providing examples for each type.

5. Pseudo-Elements
	• ::before:
  p::before {
    content: "Note: ";
    font-weight: bold;
  }
	• ::after:
  p::after {
    content: " [End]";
    font-style: italic;
  }
	• ::first-line:
  p::first-line {
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }
	• ::first-letter:
  p::first-letter {
    font-size: 2em;
    color: red;
  }
	• ::placeholder:
  input::placeholder {
    color: gray;
    font-style: italic;
  }

CSS Specificity Overview
CSS Specificity is a crucial concept in CSS that determines the order in which styles are applied. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used, such as inline styles, IDs, classes, attributes, and element types. Understanding specificity helps in:
	• Avoiding styling conflicts
	• Ensuring consistent design application
	• Maintaining control over CSS code
CSS Specificity Rules
	1. Inline CSS:
		○ Applied directly within HTML elements using the style attribute.
		○ Has the highest specificity and overrides all other selectors.
	2. Internal CSS:
		○ Defined within an HTML document’s <style> element.
		○ Specificity depends on the CSS selector used.
	3. External CSS:
		○ Styles multiple HTML pages with a single stylesheet.
		○ Specificity also depends on the CSS selector used.
Specificity Hierarchy
	• Inline style: Highest priority.
	• ID selectors: Second highest priority.
	• Classes, pseudo-classes, attributes: Medium level of specificity.
	• Elements and pseudo-elements: Lowest priority.
Examples
	• Inline CSS:
  <h2 style="color: green;">Inline CSS overrides internal CSS</h2>
	• Internal CSS:
  h1 {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
  }
	• External CSS:
  h1 {
    background-color: blue;
    color: yellow;
  }
CSS Specificity Key Points
	1. Selector-Based Specificity:
		○ Specificity is determined by the selectors themselves, not by whether styles are defined internally or externally.
	2. Equal Specificity:
		○ If selectors in external and internal CSS have the same components, their specificity is the same, regardless of the CSS rule's location.
	3. Order of Inclusion:
		○ When styles conflict, the order of inclusion in the HTML document determines which style is applied.
	4. Equal Specificity Resolution:
		○ If two or more selectors have equal specificity, the last one in the document takes precedence.
	5. Universal Selectors:
		○ Universal selectors (e.g., *, body) and inherited selectors have the least specificity.
These points help in understanding how CSS specificity works and how to manage styling conflicts effectively.


Understanding these rules and hierarchy helps in creating efficient, maintainable, and scalable stylesheets.

Sure! Here are single examples and code snippets for each level of CSS specificity:
1. Inline CSS
Inline styles have the highest specificity.
<h2 style="color: green;">This text is green due to inline CSS.</h2>
2. ID Selector
ID selectors have high specificity, but less than inline styles.
<!-- HTML -->
<p id="unique">This text is styled by an ID selector.</p>
<!-- CSS -->
#unique {
  color: blue;
}
3. Class Selector
Class selectors have medium specificity.
<!-- HTML -->
<p class="highlight">This text is styled by a class selector.</p>
<!-- CSS -->
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
4. Attribute Selector
Attribute selectors also have medium specificity.
<!-- HTML -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Styled by attribute selector">
<!-- CSS -->
input[type="text"] {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
5. Element Selector
Element selectors have the lowest specificity.
<!-- HTML -->
<p>This text is styled by an element selector.</p>
<!-- CSS -->
p {
  font-size: 18px;
}
6. Pseudo-Class Selector
Pseudo-class selectors have medium specificity.
<!-- HTML -->
<a href="#">Hover over this link</a>
<!-- CSS -->
a:hover {
  color: orange;
}
7. Pseudo-Element Selector
Pseudo-element selectors have the lowest specificity.
<!-- HTML -->
<p>This paragraph has a styled first letter.</p>
<!-- CSS -->
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 2em;
  color: red;
}
These examples should help you understand how different levels of specificity are applied in CSS. Let me know if you need further assistance!









CSS !important Rule Overview
The !important rule in CSS is used to give a property/value higher importance, ensuring it overrides other declarations regardless of specificity. It should be used sparingly to avoid complicating stylesheet management.
Key Points
	1. Syntax:
   element {
     property: value !important;
   }
	1. Usage:
		○ Forces a style to override any other declarations.
		○ Ensures the specified property value is applied.
	2. Example 1:
		○ HTML:
 <h1 style="color: blue;">GeeksforGeeks</h1>
		○ CSS:
 h1 {
   color: white !important;
 }
 body {
   background-color: yellow;
 }
	3. Example 2:
		○ HTML: html ¨K12K ¨K13K 
		○ CSS: css .geeks { color: green !important; background-color: lightgray !important; } #gfg { color: lightgreen !important; background-color: darkgreen !important; } 
Conclusion
The !important rule is a powerful tool in CSS for resolving conflicts and ensuring specific styles are applied. However, it should be used judiciously to maintain clean and manageable stylesheets.
