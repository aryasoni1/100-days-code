# üñ•Ô∏èüì± Master Summary: Responsive Web Design Essentials

### What is Responsive Web Design?
- Makes websites look great and function well on **any device** (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Uses **HTML and CSS** techniques like flexible layouts, media queries, responsive images, and videos.

---

### Core Concepts
- **Viewport**: Set via the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag to control page scaling on devices.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Use **grid** and **flexbox** with relative units to adapt the design.
- **Media Queries**: Change styles based on screen size, orientation, and device type.

---

### Techniques
- **Grid View**: Use CSS Grid to create structured, responsive page layouts.
- **Responsive Images & Videos**: 
  - `width: 100%; height: auto;`
  - `max-width: 100%` prevents upscaling.
  - Use `<picture>` for serving different images to different screen sizes.
- **CSS Units**: 
  - `px`: fixed size.
  - `em`, `rem`: relative to font-size.
  - `%`: relative to parent element.
