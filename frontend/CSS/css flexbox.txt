	• Flex Items: The child elements inside the flex container.
Flexbox Axes
	• Main Axis: Runs horizontally by default (left to right).
	• Cross Axis: Runs vertically, perpendicular to the main axis.
Flex Direction Properties
	• Row: flex-direction: row;
	• Column: flex-direction: column;
	• Reverse Directions: row-reverse; and column-reverse;
Aligning and Justifying Content
	• justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis (e.g., flex-start, center, space-between).
	• align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis (e.g., stretch, center).
	• align-content: Aligns rows within a flex container when there is extra space on the cross axis.
Examples
	• Responsive Design: Using media queries with Flexbox properties to adapt layouts to different devices.

Introduction to CSS Flexbox
	• CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model designed to create flexible and responsive structures without using float or positioning.
	• By applying display: flex to a parent container, it becomes a flex container, and its children become flex items.
Flexbox Basics
	• Flex Items: Elements that can grow, shrink, and adjust spacing within the flex container.
	• Axes:
		○ Main Axis: Direction of flex items (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
		○ Cross Axis: Perpendicular to the main axis.
Flexbox Properties
	• Parent Properties:
		○ display: Defines a flex container.
		○ flex-direction: Defines the main axis direction.
		○ flex-wrap: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines.
		○ justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis.
		○ align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis.
		○ align-content: Aligns rows within a flex container.
	• Children/Flex-items Properties:
		○ order: Changes the order of items.
		○ flex-grow: Allows an item to grow to fill available space.
		○ flex-shrink: Allows an item to shrink if there’s insufficient space.
		○ flex-basis: Defines the initial size of an item.
		○ align-self: Aligns a single item within the flex container.
Example
	• A simple example demonstrates the use of Flexbox properties to center items within a container.
Conclusion
	• CSS Flexbox provides a systematic way to design flexible and responsive layouts, enhancing web design by allowing easy arrangement, alignment, and distribution of space among items in a container.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on the CSS flex property:
CSS Flex Property Overview
	• Purpose: The flex property controls the size and behavior of items within a flexible container.
	• Components: Combines three key properties—flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
Key Properties
	1. flex-grow: Specifies how much an item will grow relative to other items.
	2. flex-shrink: Determines how much an item will shrink relative to other items when space is limited.
	3. flex-basis: Sets the initial size of a flex item before space distribution.
Syntax
/* flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis */
flex: 1 0 auto;
Examples
	• Single Value Representation: Demonstrates equal-width items adjusting dynamically.
	• Using flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis: Shows how these properties work together to control item sizes.
Browser Support
	• Widely supported across modern browsers like Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.
This page provides a detailed explanation of the CSS flex property, its values, and practical examples to help you create responsive layouts.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on CSS Flex Container:
CSS Flex Container Overview
	• Flex Container: Becomes flexible by setting display: flex.
	• Flex Items: The child elements within the flex container.
Key Properties
	1. flex-direction: Specifies the direction of the flex items (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse).
	2. flex-wrap: Determines whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines (nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse).
	3. flex-flow: A shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap.
	4. justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis (center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between, space-evenly).
	5. align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis (center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch, baseline).
	6. align-content: Aligns flex lines within the container (center, stretch, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between, space-evenly).
Examples
	• flex-direction: Demonstrates different directions (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse).
	• flex-wrap: Shows wrapping behavior (nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse).
	• justify-content: Aligns items in various ways (center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between, space-evenly).
	• align-items: Aligns items vertically (center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch, baseline).
	• align-content: Aligns flex lines (center, stretch, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between, space-evenly).

Perfect Centering
In the following example we will solve a common style problem: perfect centering.
SOLUTION: Set both the justify-content and align-items properties to center, and the flex item will be perfectly centered:
Example
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 300px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
