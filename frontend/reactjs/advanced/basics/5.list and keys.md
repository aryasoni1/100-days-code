# 📋 Lists & Keys in React

React makes it easy to render lists of elements dynamically using JavaScript’s `.map()` method. To keep track of each element, React uses **keys**, which help identify which items changed, were added, or removed.

---

## 🔁 Rendering Lists with `.map()`

The `.map()` method is used to iterate over arrays and return a React element for each item.

### Example:

```jsx
const fruits = ['🍎 Apple', '🍌 Banana', '🍇 Grape'];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

* Each item in the list gets turned into a `<li>`.
* **Avoid using `index` as the key** unless the list is static and never changes.

## 🗝️ Keys in React

**Keys** help React identify which items in a list have changed, are added, or are removed. They must be **unique among siblings**.

### Why Keys Matter:

* Improve rendering performance
* Prevent bugs in dynamic lists
* Ensure React can track element identity properly

### Good Key Examples:

```jsx
const users = [{ id: 1, name: 'Alice' }, { id: 2, name: 'Bob' }];

function UserList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map(user => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

* Use **unique IDs** from your data whenever possible.

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Pattern: Using Index as Key

```jsx
{items.map((item, index) => (
  <li key={index}>{item}</li>
))}
```

* ❌ Not ideal if items can be reordered, added, or removed.
* ✔️ OK **only** for static lists that never change.

## 📚 Summary Table

| Concept  | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `.map()` | Transforms array items into React elements        |
| `key`    | A unique identifier to help React manage the list |
| Good key | Unique, stable ID (e.g., database ID)             |
| Bad key  | Index (when list changes dynamically)             |
