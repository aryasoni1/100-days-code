Here's a concise and well-structured note in `.md` (Markdown) format for the **Render and Commit** process in React:

# 📘 React: Render and Commit Process

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- What rendering means in React  
- When and why React renders a component  
- The steps involved in displaying a component on screen  
- Why rendering does **not always** produce a DOM update  

---

## 🍽️ React as a Restaurant Analogy
1. **Trigger** (User places order) → Request is made  
2. **Render** (Kitchen prepares the order) → Components return JSX  
3. **Commit** (Order is served to table) → DOM is updated  

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Trigger a Render
React renders a component when:
- It is rendered **initially**.
- **State** or **props** change (for the component or its ancestor).

### 🔹 Initial Render Example
```js
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Image />);
```

### 🔹 Re-render on State Update
Updating state via `useState` triggers a re-render.

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Render Components
React **calls** component functions to generate JSX.

- On initial render, the **root component** is called.
- On updates, the **changed component** is re-called.
- Recursively calls child components.

```js
export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Inspiring Sculptures</h1>
      <Image />
      <Image />
      <Image />
    </section>
  );
}
```

### 🔸 Pitfall: Rendering Must Be Pure
- **Pure**: Same inputs → same output  
- Should **not mutate** external variables  
- React **Strict Mode** calls functions twice to catch impure behavior  

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Commit to the DOM
- On initial render → React uses `appendChild()` to build the DOM.  
- On re-render → React performs **minimal DOM changes**.

### 🔸 Example: Controlled Update
```js
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{time}</h1>
      <input />
    </>
  );
}
```
- Only updates `<h1>` if `time` changes  
- Keeps `<input>` untouched → preserves value

---

## 🎨 Final Step: Browser Paint
- After React updates the DOM, **the browser repaints the UI**.

---

## 🔁 Recap: Three Phases of Update
1. **Trigger**: Initial render or state/props update  
2. **Render**: React calls functions to produce JSX  
3. **Commit**: React applies changes to the DOM  

> 🔍 Use **React Strict Mode** to catch side-effects and impure rendering logic early in development.
