Perfect! Here are **50 Node.js coding practice problems**, mapped to your detailed Node.js roadmap‚Äîfrom fundamentals to backend, full-stack, and interview-level challenges.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Node.js Fundamentals (All Roles)**

*Get comfortable with Node core features and async patterns*

1. Write a Node script that prints system info (`os` module).
2. Create a file using `fs.writeFile` and read it back.
3. Create a basic HTTP server with `http` module on port 3000.
4. Parse a URL query string using the `url` module.
5. Hash a string using `crypto` (SHA256).
6. Create a timer using `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
7. Demonstrate callback hell with nested file reads.
8. Convert the above to Promises, then to `async/await`.
9. Write a function that returns a Promise and simulate async behavior.
10. Write a custom module and import it using both `require` and `import`.

## üéØ **2. Node.js for Frontend Developers**

*Focus on tooling, scripts, and frontend-dev server setups*

11. Create a `package.json` with custom scripts: `start`, `dev`, `build`.
12. Use Node to spin up a development server with `express.static`.
13. Setup a mock API server using Express with two routes.
14. Install and run `vite` from a Node script to serve a React/Vue app.
15. Automate SCSS to CSS conversion using Node + `sass`.

## üíª **3. Node.js for Backend Developers**

*API development, database integration, auth, and logging*

16. Create a basic Express app with `/hello` route.
17. Build a middleware that logs incoming requests.
18. Use `mongoose` to connect to MongoDB and define a User model.
19. Write a login route that checks hashed password with `bcrypt`.
20. Generate a JWT token after successful login using `jsonwebtoken`.
21. Create a protected route that checks JWT.
22. Build a CSV-to-JSON converter using streams.
23. Upload files using Express and `multer`.
24. Use `pg` to connect to a PostgreSQL database and run a query.
25. Add structured logging with `winston` and output to a log file.

## üåê **4. Node.js for Full-Stack Developers**

*Build integrated backend services for real apps*

26. Create a REST API with full CRUD for posts.
27. Use `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
28. Create a multi-environment config (dev/staging/prod).
29. Build a chat feature using `socket.io` for real-time messaging.
30. Use `apollo-server-express` to build a GraphQL endpoint.
31. Serve your frontend React app from the backend using Express.
32. Handle async file uploads and return progress via WebSocket.
33. Structure your project with MVC pattern.
34. Add a rate limiter using `express-rate-limit`.
35. Deploy your Node app to Heroku and set up config vars.

## üß† **5. Node.js for SDE Interviews**

*System design, patterns, advanced internals*

36. Implement a singleton logger service in Node.
37. Write your own simple EventEmitter class.
38. Explain and simulate phases of the event loop.
39. Use the `cluster` module to spawn multiple worker processes.
40. Implement a basic message queue using Redis and `bull`.
41. Create a cron job to clean up old user data (use `node-cron`).
42. Design a rate-limited API using in-memory storage (e.g., token bucket).
43. Write a service to batch DB writes every 10 seconds.
44. Add graceful shutdown handling (`SIGINT`, `process.exit`).
45. Use `pm2` to run and monitor your Node app in cluster mode.

## üöÄ **6. Advanced Projects and Performance**

*Scalability, observability, distributed systems*

46. Create a Redis-backed session manager for Express.
47. Build a distributed job processor with Node and RabbitMQ.
48. Add performance monitoring with `newrelic` or `datadog`.
49. Design a pub/sub architecture using Redis and `socket.io`.
50. Build an analytics logger that writes to file and pushes to external API asynchronously.
