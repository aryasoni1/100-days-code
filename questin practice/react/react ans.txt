Sure! Here's a simple **React functional component** that displays `"Hello, React!"`, along with a full explanation for beginners.

### âœ… React Functional Component Code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function HelloReact() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
  );
}

export default HelloReact;
```

---

### ðŸ§  Explanation:

#### 1. `import React from 'react';`

* This line **imports React** so you can use JSX (Reactâ€™s syntax that looks like HTML).
* In modern React (v17+), this line is **optional** if youâ€™re using a setup that supports JSX automatically (like Create React App or Vite).

#### 2. `function HelloReact() { ... }`

* This defines a **functional component** named `HelloReact`.
* A **component** is a reusable piece of UI in React.
* A **functional component** is just a regular JavaScript function that returns JSX.

#### 3. `return ( <h1>Hello, React!</h1> );`

* This is what the component renders on the screen.
* `h1` is a heading tag, and React knows how to render it in the DOM.

#### 4. `export default HelloReact;`

* This line **exports the component** so you can use it in another file, like in `App.js`.

### ðŸ§ª Usage in Another File (e.g., `App.js`):

```jsx
import HelloReact from './HelloReact';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <HelloReact />
    </div>
  );
}
```
