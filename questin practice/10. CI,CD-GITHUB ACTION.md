Awesome! Based on your CI/CD + GitHub Actions roadmap, here‚Äôs a **50+ hands-on practice set**, structured just like your Next.js example. It's divided into progressive levels to help you build automation, deployment, and DevOps muscle memory.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. GitHub Actions Fundamentals (All Roles)**

**Understand workflows, syntax, and automation basics.**

1. Create a GitHub repo and add your first workflow file in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. Write a workflow that triggers on `push` to `main` and prints ‚ÄúHello GitHub Actions‚Äù using `run: echo`.
3. Add multiple steps to install dependencies and print the current directory contents.
4. Trigger a workflow manually using `workflow_dispatch`.
5. Customize the name of your workflow using the `name:` field.
6. Use `on.push.branches` to only run your workflow on `main` and `dev` branches.
7. Create a pull request and configure your workflow to run only on `pull_request`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Jobs, Steps & Built-in Actions**

**Work with job structure, operating systems, and built-in actions.**

8. Add a job that runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
9. Use `actions/checkout@v3` to clone the repo inside your job.
10. Use `actions/setup-node` to set up Node.js v18.
11. Install dependencies and run `npm test` in your workflow.
12. Set up Java 17 using `actions/setup-java`.
13. Run a Maven build inside your workflow.
14. Add two jobs that run sequentially using `needs:`.

---

## üå± **3. Testing and Code Quality**

**Add automated tests, linters, and coverage.**

15. Create a workflow to run `npm run lint` on every push.
16. Add `pytest` to test a Python app.
17. Use `jest` or `mocha` to test a Node.js project.
18. Upload a test coverage report as an artifact.
19. Fail the build if tests don‚Äôt pass.
20. Add an ESLint step to enforce code quality.
21. Add a badge to your `README.md` showing CI status.

---

## üöö **4. Deployment Workflows (Frontend & Backend)**

**Build and deploy projects using GitHub Actions.**

22. Build a React/Vite project using `npm run build`.
23. Deploy to Vercel or Netlify using official integrations.
24. Build a Spring Boot app with Maven or Gradle.
25. Deploy your Spring Boot JAR to a remote server using `scp` + SSH.
26. Use Firebase CLI to deploy a frontend using a GitHub Action.
27. Deploy a static site to GitHub Pages using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`.
28. Use environment secrets for API keys in a workflow.
29. Create separate workflows for dev, staging, and production environments.
30. Send a Slack message after successful deployment using a Slack webhook.

---

## üîê **5. Secrets & Secure DevOps**

**Store and use secrets and API keys securely.**

31. Store a secret token using GitHub Secrets.
32. Use `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}` in a workflow step.
33. Restrict a deployment job to run only on protected branches.
34. Add a condition: only deploy if tests pass (`if: success()`).
35. Use `env:` to define environment variables used in multiple steps.
36. Block secrets from being printed in logs using `::add-mask::`.

---

## ‚ö° **6. Matrix Builds & Caching**

**Build and test across environments efficiently.**

37. Run tests in parallel across Node.js versions 14, 16, 18 using a matrix strategy.
38. Add a matrix build to test your app on Ubuntu and Windows.
39. Use `actions/cache` to cache `node_modules` or `.m2` directory.
40. Store build artifacts using `actions/upload-artifact`.
41. Download artifacts in a second job using `actions/download-artifact`.

---

## üîÅ **7. Advanced & Reusable Workflows**

**Optimize workflows for teams and reuse logic.**

42. Create a reusable workflow in `.github/workflows/shared.yml`.
43. Call the shared workflow from another using `workflow_call`.
44. Define a custom composite GitHub Action using `action.yml`.
45. Move duplicate logic into a composite action and reuse it across workflows.
46. Use a custom Docker container for your workflow.

---

## üß† **8. Monitoring, Alerts & Optimization**

**Track status, add observability, and make CI/CD fast.**

47. Send email notifications when a workflow fails using `if: failure()`.
48. Configure conditional steps using `if: github.event_name == 'push'`.
49. Limit workflows to only run when files in certain paths change.
50. Add job-level timeouts using `timeout-minutes`.
51. Use `concurrency` to prevent overlapping deployments (auto-cancel in-flight runs).

## Bonus Project-Based Practice

### Beginner Projects:

* Automate build + test of a Node.js CLI tool.
* Deploy a static portfolio to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Intermediate Projects:

* CI/CD pipeline for a MERN app with MongoDB Atlas + Vercel frontend.
* Test + deploy Spring Boot app to EC2 using SSH GitHub Actions.

### Advanced Projects:

* Matrix-based CI pipeline testing across multiple environments.
* Secure CD pipeline to Kubernetes using `kubectl` and secrets.
* Reusable workflow for multi-repo monorepo management (e.g., TurboRepo + Actions).
