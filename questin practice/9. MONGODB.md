Got it! Here‚Äôs a **MongoDB 50+ coding practice set** mapped to your roadmap, covering all levels from fundamentals to system design and interviews.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. MongoDB Core Fundamentals (All Roles)**

1. Install MongoDB locally and connect using `mongosh`. Create a new database and collection.
2. Insert a single document into a collection using `insertOne()`.
3. Insert multiple documents at once using `insertMany()`.
4. Find all documents in a collection with `find()`.
5. Use `findOne()` to get a single document matching a filter.
6. Use projections in `find()` to return only specific fields.
7. Update a document with `updateOne()` using `$set` to change a field.
8. Increment a numeric field in documents using `$inc`.
9. Append an element to an array field using `$push`.
10. Delete a single document using `deleteOne()`.
11. Delete multiple documents matching a filter with `deleteMany()`.
12. Use comparison query operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, and `$in` in `find()`.
13. Use logical operators `$or` and `$and` to combine query conditions.
14. Query documents where a field exists or is missing using `$exists`.
15. Write a query to find documents where an array contains all specified values using `$all`.
16. Design a schema to store user profiles using embedding for address and referencing for posts.

## üéØ **2. MongoDB for Frontend Developers**

17. Build a simple Express.js backend with an endpoint that fetches documents from MongoDB and returns JSON to the frontend.
18. Use Axios or Fetch API in React to call the backend and display MongoDB data.
19. Implement pagination in a React app by fetching data from MongoDB in pages (limit and skip).
20. Use TypeScript interfaces to define MongoDB document shapes and validate data on the frontend.
21. In Next.js API routes, fetch MongoDB data with `getServerSideProps()` and render on the server.
22. Create a page using `getStaticProps()` and `getStaticPaths()` that dynamically generates blog posts stored in MongoDB.
23. Cache MongoDB query results on the frontend using React Query or SWR for faster rendering.
24. Discuss the pros and cons of embedding user preferences inside user documents versus referencing a separate preferences collection.
25. Implement search filtering on the frontend by querying MongoDB with text indexes and updating results live.

## üíª **3. MongoDB for Backend Developers**

26. Set up user authentication using JWT stored in MongoDB for session management.
27. Implement role-based access control (admin/user) in MongoDB documents and enforce it in your Express API.
28. Create single-field and compound indexes on collections to speed up frequent queries.
29. Use the MongoDB `explain()` method to analyze and optimize a slow query.
30. Write an aggregation pipeline that groups orders by user and calculates total spending per user.
31. Use `$lookup` to join user documents with their orders in an aggregation.
32. Write an aggregation pipeline that filters documents by date range and sorts by price.
33. Implement data validation in MongoDB schema using Mongoose‚Äôs built-in validators.
34. Use pre-save Mongoose middleware (hooks) to hash user passwords before storing.
35. Secure your MongoDB API routes by adding CORS headers and validating request origins.
36. Build an API endpoint that streams large files stored in MongoDB GridFS.

## üåê **4. MongoDB for Full-Stack Developers**

37. Build a full CRUD TODO app with a React frontend, Express API, and MongoDB backend.
38. Add user registration and login with NextAuth.js and MongoDB user store.
39. Implement role-based access so only admins can delete users or manage content.
40. Create a real-time chat feature using MongoDB Change Streams and Socket.io.
41. Use `.populate()` in Mongoose to fetch referenced user details when querying posts.
42. Implement form validation on both frontend and backend with schema checks.
43. Store uploaded images in MongoDB using GridFS and display them in React.
44. Use environment variables in `.env.local` for database connection strings and secrets.
45. Implement server-side rendering (SSR) of user-specific data using `getServerSideProps()` in Next.js.
46. Build a blog CMS with posts, comments, likes, and tag filters with full stack integration.

## üß† **5. MongoDB for SDE Interviews & System Design**

47. Design a replica set for a MongoDB cluster and explain primary/secondary failover.
48. Write a sharding strategy to scale a product catalog with a suitable shard key.
49. Design a rate limiter using MongoDB that tracks API requests per user per minute.
50. Create a text index for a product search engine and optimize queries using indexes.
51. Design a high-volume user activity logging system storing millions of events per day in MongoDB.
52. Implement a caching layer with TTL indexes to expire session documents automatically.
53. Write a script to migrate a legacy SQL dataset into MongoDB with appropriate schema mapping.
54. Add encryption-at-rest and TLS to secure MongoDB data and connections.
55. Set up monitoring and alerting for slow queries and disk usage using MongoDB Atlas or Prometheus.
56. Design a scalable leaderboard using aggregation pipelines updated in real-time.

## üéØ **Bonus MongoDB Mini-Projects**

57. Build a contact book with CRUD and search filters.
58. Create an authentication system with JWT, refresh tokens, and MongoDB session store.
59. Develop a blog platform with tags, likes, comments, and user profiles.
60. Build a real-time chat app with MongoDB Change Streams and WebSockets.
61. Create an e-commerce backend with product catalog, pagination, cart management, and Stripe integration.
