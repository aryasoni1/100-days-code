Absolutely! Here's a **React.js coding practice set** with **50+ hands-on questions** mapped directly to the **roadmap you provided**. This will take you from **beginner to advanced level**‚Äîperfect for frontend developers, full-stack engineers, and SDE interview prep.

## ‚úÖ **1. React.js Fundamentals (All Roles)**

*Start with component structure, props, state, and rendering.*

1. Create a functional component that displays "Hello, React!"
2. Create a component that accepts `name` as a prop and displays it.
3. Build a simple counter using `useState`.
4. Create a toggle component that shows/hides content on button click.
5. Display a list of users using `.map()` and keys.
6. Build a basic form with input fields for name and email.
7. Create a greeting component that changes message based on the time.
8. Use conditional rendering to show ‚ÄúLogged in‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlease log in‚Äù.
9. Pass a function from parent to child and call it on a button click.
10. Create a component with internal state that updates after 2 seconds using `setTimeout`.

## üéØ **2. React for Frontend Development**

*Focus on routing, state management, styling, and form handling.*

11. Set up routing between two pages (`Home`, `About`) using React Router.
12. Create a dynamic route that displays details from a URL param.
13. Build a simple authentication flow with a protected route.
14. Use `useReducer` to build a simple todo list.
15. Use Context API to manage and display a theme across components.
16. Create a controlled form with name, email, and password inputs.
17. Integrate React Hook Form to handle form validation.
18. Add Tailwind CSS and style a button and card component.
19. Use styled-components to style a custom `Card` component.
20. Create a reusable `Button` component that accepts props for color and text.

## üíª **3. React for Backend Integration**

*Learn how to work with APIs, tokens, and async operations.*

21. Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and display it in a table.
22. Handle loading and error states when fetching posts.
23. Submit a form and post data to a backend API.
24. Build a login form and store the token in localStorage.
25. Create a logout button that clears the token and redirects to login.
26. Use Axios to fetch and post data with headers.
27. Implement a token refresh mechanism (mocked).
28. Protect a route so only authenticated users can access it.
29. Use `.env` file and read a `REACT_APP_API_URL` variable.
30. Create a user profile page that fetches data after login using `useEffect`.

---

## üåê **4. Full-Stack React Development (MERN or any stack)**

*Combine your frontend with an Express backend (mock or real).*

31. Connect to a Node.js/Express backend API and fetch data.
32. Create a reusable Axios service (`api.js`) for GET/POST requests.
33. Submit a form and validate both client-side and server-side.
34. Build a shopping cart with Add/Remove functionality (store in context).
35. Display real-time messages using Socket.io from the backend.
36. Create a custom hook for fetching data (`useFetch`).
37. Add loading spinners and toasts using `react-toastify`.
38. Create a search bar with debounce for filtering items.
39. Display success/error messages based on API response.
40. Connect form submission to Express backend and handle errors gracefully.

## üß† **5. React for SDE Interviews & Scalable Architecture**

*Prepare for real-world interviews: optimization, testing, patterns.*

41. Write a custom hook that toggles a boolean (`useToggle`).
42. Use `useRef` to focus an input on mount.
43. Create a memoized component using `React.memo`.
44. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary renders.
45. Test a component using React Testing Library.
46. Mock an API call in Jest and test loading + success state.
47. Split a large component into container/presentation components.
48. Create a compound component (e.g., Tabs with TabList, TabPanel).
49. Implement a lazy-loaded route using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
50. Optimize a large list rendering using virtualization (e.g., react-window).
51. Build a reusable `Modal` component with close on outside click.
52. Write a debounce utility and use it in a search bar component.
