Absolutely! Here's a **set of 50 Express.js coding practice problems**, aligned with your detailed roadmap. These are organized by fundamentals, frontend/backend integration, full-stack apps, and interview-level challenges.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Express.js Fundamentals (All Roles)**

*Build foundational skills around Express routing, middleware, and request handling.*

1. Create a basic Express server that listens on port 3000.
2. Define a route `/hello` that returns `Hello World`.
3. Create a dynamic route `/user/:id` and log the `id` param.
4. Parse and respond to query strings in `/search?q=term`.
5. Add and test middleware that logs every incoming request.
6. Use `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` for body parsing.
7. Create a custom middleware that appends a timestamp to each request.
8. Serve static HTML and CSS using `express.static()`.
9. Return 404 for all unhandled routes using a catch-all route.
10. Send different HTTP status codes (`200`, `400`, `404`, `500`) in various routes.

## üéØ **2. Express.js for Frontend Developers**

*Practice SSR, CORS, and frontend-backend communication.*

11. Create a static Express site with HTML, CSS, and JS.
12. Render a dynamic page using EJS or Pug templating.
13. Setup CORS to allow requests from a frontend React app.
14. Connect your Express API to a React frontend using `axios`.
15. Implement a `/form` route that accepts and logs POST data from an HTML form.

## üíª **3. Express.js for Backend Developers**

*API design, authentication, validation, and security practices.*

16. Build a RESTful API with full CRUD for a `Product` resource.
17. Organize your routes using Express `Router`.
18. Create error-handling middleware that catches exceptions.
19. Secure an endpoint using a JWT token with `jsonwebtoken`.
20. Add role-based access control (admin vs user).
21. Validate incoming POST data using `express-validator`.
22. Use `helmet` to secure HTTP headers.
23. Implement rate limiting with `express-rate-limit`.
24. Protect your API from XSS and CSRF attacks (with `xss-clean`, CSRF tokens).
25. Allow file uploads (images or docs) using `multer`.

## üåê **4. Express.js for Full-Stack Developers**

*Build real-world apps with Express and frontend frameworks.*

26. Create a fullstack blog using Express (backend) + React (frontend).
27. Connect MongoDB using `mongoose` and create a Post schema.
28. Add environment variable support with `dotenv`.
29. Implement an MVC folder structure for a large Express project.
30. Serve your built React frontend from your Express app.
31. Set up a real-time chat API using Express + `socket.io`.
32. Add SSE (Server-Sent Events) to send live updates to frontend.
33. Proxy frontend `/api` requests to Express backend in development.
34. Create API versioning (`/api/v1/posts`, `/api/v2/posts`).
35. Deploy a fullstack Express + React app on Render or Railway.

## üß† **5. Express.js for SDE Interviews**

*Design-focused and architecture-heavy challenges for interview preparation.*

36. Design and implement a scalable REST API for a social media platform.
37. Write a centralized logger using `winston` for all routes.
38. Create a global error handler with `try/catch` and custom error classes.
39. Build a worker job queue using `bull` or `agenda` for email sending.
40. Write middleware that formats all responses in a consistent JSON shape.
41. Handle concurrent requests and simulate race conditions.
42. Implement request timeout middleware that kills long-running requests.
43. Use `cluster` to run Express on multiple CPU cores.
44. Create a microservice using Express that communicates with another via HTTP.
45. Integrate Redis as a caching layer for expensive DB calls.

---

## üöÄ **6. Advanced Projects and Performance Tuning**

46. Build a multi-role authentication system (admin, user, guest).
47. Create a chat server with Express + Socket.io + Redis Pub/Sub.
48. Implement pagination, sorting, and filtering on a REST API.
49. Add real-time monitoring with `pm2` and visualize logs.
50. Build a dashboard that shows Express server metrics using Prometheus.
