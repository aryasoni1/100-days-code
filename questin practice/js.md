Great! Here's a **JavaScript coding practice set with 50+ hands-on problems**, perfectly aligned with the structured roadmap you shared ‚Äî from fundamentals to frontend, backend, full-stack, and SDE interview prep.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. JavaScript Fundamentals (All Roles)**

*Grasp syntax, control flow, data types, and functions.*

1. Declare a variable and assign your name to it.
2. Write a function to check if a number is even or odd.
3. Create a function that returns the factorial of a number.
4. Write a program to reverse a string.
5. Use `switch` to display a day name based on number input (1 = Monday).
6. Write a function that returns the largest number from an array.
7. Create a function that adds all numbers in a list using `reduce()`.
8. Use `for...of` to iterate over an array and log each item.
9. Demonstrate hoisting with `var`, `let`, and `const`.
10. Use a `try...catch` block to catch division-by-zero errors.

## üéØ **2. JavaScript for Frontend Developers**

*Focus on DOM, events, async behavior, and browser APIs.*

11. Select an element by ID and change its text content.
12. Create a button that shows an alert on click.
13. Build a simple form and prevent submission using `preventDefault()`.
14. Toggle a class on an element when clicked.
15. Fetch data from an API and display it in a `<div>`.
16. Build a character counter for a textarea.
17. Use `setTimeout` to delay a message by 3 seconds.
18. Implement an image slider with Next/Previous buttons.
19. Store user input in `localStorage` and retrieve it on page reload.
20. Create a light/dark mode toggle and persist it using `localStorage`.

## üíª **3. JavaScript for Backend Developers (Node.js)**

*Use JS in the server environment for APIs, files, and databases.*

21. Create a simple Express server that returns ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù.
22. Read a text file and log its contents using `fs.readFile`.
23. Create a route `/user/:id` that returns a dynamic response.
24. Write middleware to log request method and URL.
25. Connect to MongoDB and fetch all documents in a collection.
26. Create a POST route that accepts JSON and stores it in memory.
27. Handle an invalid route with a 404 error handler.
28. Use async/await to make an API call from your server.
29. Use `dotenv` to store and access environment variables.
30. Create an API endpoint that returns current server time in JSON.

---

## üåê **4. JavaScript for Full-Stack Developers**

*Integrate client and server using JS everywhere.*

31. Build a form in HTML and submit it to a Node.js API using `fetch`.
32. Create a login form and send credentials to the backend.
33. Implement JWT-based login flow: frontend sends, backend validates.
34. Use `axios` in frontend to call an Express API.
35. Display a product list fetched from a MongoDB backend.
36. Add a loading spinner while an API call is being made.
37. Create a WebSocket connection with `Socket.io` and emit a message.
38. Upload a file from frontend and handle it in Express.
39. Create a user registration form with client-side + server-side validation.
40. Deploy your full-stack app with Render (server) and Netlify (client).

---

## üß† **5. JavaScript for SDE Interviews**

*Algorithms, data structures, higher-order functions, and performance.*

41. Implement a function to check for palindromes.
42. Write a function to flatten a nested array.
43. Implement a custom `map()` function.
44. Write a function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.
45. Use closures to maintain a private counter.
46. Debounce an input field so it only logs after typing stops for 500ms.
47. Write a function to deep clone an object.
48. Use `Set` to remove duplicate values from an array.
49. Create a function that returns the most frequent element in an array.
50. Write a memoized version of a function that adds two numbers.
51. Implement a stack using JavaScript arrays.
52. Create a throttle function that limits how often a function can run.

## Bonus Challenges: **Project-Based Learning**

### Beginner:

* Counter app using buttons (increment/decrement/reset).
* Form validation: check for empty fields and valid email.

### Intermediate:

* Weather app using the OpenWeather API.
* Notes app with persistent storage using localStorage.

### Advanced:

* Real-time chat app using Socket.io.
* Full-stack blog app (React + Express + MongoDB).
