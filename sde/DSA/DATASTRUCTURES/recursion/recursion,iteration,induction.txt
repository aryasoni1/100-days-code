# üìò Recursion vs Iteration

**Last Updated:** 22 May, 2023

## ‚úÖ Definitions

- **Recursion**: A function that calls itself to solve sub-instances of a problem.
- **Iteration**: Repeated execution of a set of statements using loops.

---

## üîç Code Example: Factorial

### ‚û§ Using Recursion

```python
def factorialUsingRecursion(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorialUsingRecursion(n - 1)
```

### ‚û§ Using Iteration

```python
def factorialUsingIteration(n):
    res = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        res *= i
    return res
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Approach     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity         |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Recursion    | Exponential (O(2^n) in some cases) | O(n) due to call stack |
| Iteration    | Linear (O(n))    | O(1)                      |

| Infinite Repetition   | Risk of stack overflow                          | Can cause infinite loop, less dangerous        |

## üìå Usage Considerations

- Use **recursion** when:
  - Problem has a naturally recursive structure (trees, graphs, etc.)
  - Code simplicity is preferred over performance

- Use **iteration** when:
  - Time and space efficiency is crucial
  - Avoiding function call overhead is important

# üß† Recursion vs Induction

**Last Updated:** 01 Aug, 2024

## üìñ Definitions

- **Recursion**: Programming method where a function solves a problem by calling itself.
- **Induction**: Mathematical technique to prove a statement for all natural numbers.

---

## üìö Structure

### Recursion
- **Base Case**: Terminates the recursive calls.
- **Recursive Step**: Breaks the problem and calls the function again.

### Induction
- **Base Step**: Prove for initial value (e.g., n = 1).
- **Inductive Step**: Assume true for `n = k`, prove for `n = k+1`.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Example

### Recursion
```text
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Base: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
```

### Induction
Prove: F(n) ‚â§ 2^n  
1. Base Case: F(1) = 1 ‚â§ 2  
2. Assume F(k) ‚â§ 2^k  
3. Show F(k+1) ‚â§ 2^(k+1)

## üìù Conclusion

- **Recursion** is practical in coding; **Induction** is theoretical in math.
- Use recursion for solving, induction for proving.
- Both share similar structural logic but are applied in different domains.
