# 📊 Graphs in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## 📌 What is a Graph?
A **Graph** is a **non-linear data structure** consisting of:
- **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent entities.
- **Edges**: Represent relationships/connections between nodes.

### 🔁 Why Non-Linear?
Unlike arrays or linked lists, graphs allow multiple paths between nodes.

## 📚 Real-world Applications of Graphs
- **Social Networks**: People as nodes, relationships as edges.
- **Maps & Navigation**: Places as nodes, roads as edges.
- **Internet**: Web pages as nodes, hyperlinks as edges.
- **Biology**: Modeling neural networks, spread of diseases, etc.

## ⚙️ Graph Properties

| Property       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Weighted**   | Edges have weights (distance, cost, etc.) |
| **Connected**  | All vertices are reachable from any other |
| **Directed**   | Edges have directions |
| **Cyclic**     | Contains at least one cycle |
| **Loop**       | Edge starts and ends at the same vertex |

## 🧠 Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Graph**: Edges don't have direction.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have a direction.
- **Weighted Graph**: Edges carry a value (weight).
- **Cyclic Graph**: At least one cycle is present.
- **Acyclic Graph**: No cycles present.
- **Connected Graph**: There's a path between every pair of vertices.
- **Disconnected Graph**: At least one pair of vertices is not connected.

## 🗂 Graph Representations

### 1️⃣ Adjacency Matrix
- 2D array where `matrix[i][j]` stores:
  - `1` for edge between `i` and `j` (unweighted),
  - Weight for weighted edge,
  - `0` or `∞` if no edge.
- **Best for** dense graphs.
- **Space**: O(V²)

#### 🔷 Example:
```txt
Vertices: A, B, C, D
Matrix:
    A B C D
A [ 0 1 1 1 ]
B [ 1 0 0 0 ]
C [ 1 0 0 0 ]
D [ 1 0 0 0 ]
```

---

### 2️⃣ Adjacency List
- Array of lists.
- Each vertex points to a list of its adjacent nodes.
- Can store weights as `(index, weight)`.
- **Best for** sparse graphs.
- **Space**: O(V + E)

#### 🔷 Example:
```txt
Vertices: A, B, C, D
List:
A → [B, C, D]
B → [A]
C → [A]
D → [A]
```

#### 🔷 Weighted Directed Example:
```txt
A → [(B, 3), (C, 2)]
B → [(C, 1)]
D → [(A, 4)]
```

| Representation     | Space Complexity | Best For         | Notes                                  |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Adjacency Matrix   | O(V²)            | Dense Graphs     | Easy to implement                      |
| Adjacency List     | O(V + E)         | Sparse Graphs    | More space-efficient and flexible      |
