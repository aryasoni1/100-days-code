Here’s a beginner-friendly and well-structured `.md` formatted note on **Class vs Instance Variables** in Python:

# 🧠 **Class vs Instance Variables in Python**

> Understand the difference between variables that belong to the **class** and those unique to **each object**.

---

## 🧪 **Instance Variables**

* Defined **inside the constructor** (`__init__`).
* Belong to **individual objects** (instances).
* Each object can have **different values**.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable

d1 = Dog("Buddy")
d2 = Dog("Max")

print(d1.name)  # Buddy
print(d2.name)  # Max
```

---

## 🏛️ **Class Variables**

* Shared by **all instances** of the class.
* Defined **outside `__init__`**, usually at the top of the class.
* Used for **constants** or values common to all objects.

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis Familiaris"  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable

d1 = Dog("Buddy")
d2 = Dog("Max")

print(d1.species)  # Canis Familiaris
print(d2.species)  # Canis Familiaris
```

## ⚖️ **Comparison Table**

| Feature            | Instance Variable      | Class Variable                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Defined In         | Inside `__init__()`    | Outside `__init__()`, at class level |
| Belongs To         | Specific object (self) | Entire class                         |
| Unique Per Object? | Yes                    | No (shared across all instances)     |
| Modified By        | `self.variable`        | `ClassName.variable` or `cls`        |

---

## 🔄 **Changing Class Variable**

```python
Dog.species = "Wolf"  # Changes for all instances
```

> 🧠 You can **override a class variable per instance**, but then it becomes an instance variable for that object only.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Use **class variables** for constants (e.g., default settings, version).
* Use **instance variables** to hold **object-specific data**.

Let me know if you'd like to move on to:

* **Class vs Static vs Instance Methods**
* **OOP in practice (inheritance, abstraction)**
* **Python decorators or design patterns**
  or anything else in the Python track!
