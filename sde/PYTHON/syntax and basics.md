Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on Input and Output in Python:
	• Taking Input:
		○ The input() function is used to take user input, which is returned as a string by default.
		○ Example: name = input("Enter your name: ")
	• Printing Output:
		○ The print() function is used to display text, variables, and expressions on the console.
		○ Example: print("Hello, World!")
	• Multiple Inputs:
		○ You can take multiple inputs in a single line using the split() method.
		○ Example: x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
	• Conditional Input:
		○ Input can be processed conditionally using if-elif-else statements.
		○ Example: Checking age to determine if the user is a minor, adult, or senior citizen.
	• Typecasting Input:
		○ Input can be typecast to other data types like int or float.
		○ Example: n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
	• Output Formatting:
		○ Various techniques like format(), sep and end parameters, f-strings, and % operator are used for formatting output.
		○ Example: print(f"Hello, {name}!")

Sure! Here are some examples and code snippets for each section:
Taking Input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
Printing Output
print("Hello, World!")
Multiple Inputs
x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
print("First value:", x)
print("Second value:", y)
Conditional Input
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
Typecasting Input
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The number you entered is:", n)
Output Formatting
Using format() method:
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, {}!".format(name))
Using f-strings:
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
Using % operator:
name = "Alice"
print("Hello, %s!" % name)
Using sep and end parameters:
print("Hello", "World", sep=", ", end="!")

Here's a summary of the page on Python Variables:
Overview
	• Variables store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution.
	• Python variables do not require explicit type declaration; the type is inferred from the assigned value.
Key Concepts
	1. Naming Rules:
		○ Can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
		○ Cannot start with a digit.
		○ Case-sensitive and should avoid Python keywords.
	2. Assigning Values:
		○ Use the = operator for assignment.
		○ Supports dynamic typing and multiple assignments in a single line.
	3. Type Casting:
		○ Convert values between types using functions like int(), float(), and str().
	4. Variable Scope:
		○ Local Variables: Defined within a function.
		○ Global Variables: Defined outside any function and accessible globally.
	5. Object Reference:
		○ Variables hold references to objects, not the objects themselves.
		○ Reassigning a variable does not affect other variables referencing the same object.
	6. Deleting Variables:
		○ Use the del keyword to delete a variable and free up memory.
Practical Examples
	• Swapping Variables:
  a, b = 5, 10
  a, b = b, a
	• Counting Characters in a String:
  word = "Python"
  length = len(word)
  print("Length of the word:", length)
Would you like more details on any specific section?

Sure! Here are some example codes for the topics mentioned in the summary of Python Variables:
Naming Rules
# Valid variable names
my_variable = 10
variable123 = "Hello"
_variable = 5.5
# Invalid variable names
# 123variable = "Hi"  # Cannot start with a digit
# my-variable = 20    # Hyphens are not allowed
Assigning Values
# Single assignment
x = 5
y = "Python"
# Multiple assignments
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
Type Casting
# Converting string to integer
num_str = "100"
num_int = int(num_str)
# Converting integer to float
num_float = float(num_int)
# Converting integer to string
num_str_again = str(num_int)
Variable Scope
# Global variable
global_var = "I am global"
def my_function():
    # Local variable
    local_var = "I am local"
    print(local_var)
    print(global_var)
my_function()
print(global_var)
# print(local_var)  # This will cause an error as local_var is not accessible outside the function
Object Reference
# Variables holding references to objects
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1  # list2 references the same object as list1
list2.append(4)
print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Reassigning list2
list2 = [5, 6, 7]
print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list2)  # Output: [5, 6, 7]
Deleting Variables
# Deleting a variable
var = 10
print(var)  # Output: 10
del var
# print(var)  # This will cause an error as var is deleted

Here's a summary of the page on Conditional Statements in Python:
Overview
	• Conditional statements control the flow of a program based on specific conditions.
	• They allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether conditions are true or false.
Types of Conditional Statements
	1. If Statement:
		○ Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
		○ Example:
 age = 20
 if age >= 18:
     print("Eligible to vote.")
	2. Short Hand If:
		○ A single-line if statement.
		○ Example:
 age = 19
 if age > 18: print("Eligible to Vote.")
	3. If-Else Statement:
		○ Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
		○ Example:
 age = 10
 if age <= 12:
     print("Travel for free.")
 else:
     print("Pay for ticket.")
	4. Short Hand If-Else (Ternary Operator):
		○ A compact way to write an if-else statement.
		○ Example:
 marks = 45
 res = "Pass" if marks >= 40 else "Fail"
 print(f"Result: {res}")
	5. Elif Statement:
		○ Checks multiple conditions and executes the corresponding block of code for the first true condition.
		○ Example:
 age = 25
 if age <= 12:
     print("Child.")
 elif age <= 19:
     print("Teenager.")
 elif age <= 35:
     print("Young adult.")
 else:
     print("Adult.")
	6. Nested If-Else:
		○ An if-else statement inside another if statement.
		○ Example:
 age = 70
 is_member = True
 if age >= 60:
     if is_member:
         print("30% senior discount!")
     else:
         print("20% senior discount.")
 else:
     print("Not eligible for a senior discount.")
	7. Match-Case Statement:
		○ Python's version of a switch-case statement.
		○ Example: python number = 2 match number: case 1: print("One") case 2 | 3: print("Two or Three") case _: print("Other number")

Here's a summary of the page on Loops in Python:
Overview
	• Loops are used to repeat actions efficiently.
	• Main types: For loops (counting through items) and While loops (based on conditions).
	• Nested Loops allow looping within loops for more complex tasks.
While Loop
	• Executes a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
	• Syntax:
  while expression:
      statement(s)
	• Example:
  cnt = 0
  while cnt < 3:
      cnt += 1
      print("Hello Geek")
For Loop
	• Used for sequential traversal (e.g., lists, strings).
	• Syntax:
  for iterator_var in sequence:
      statement(s)
	• Example:
  for i in range(4):
      print(i)
Nested Loops
	• One loop inside another loop.
	• Syntax:
  for iterator_var in sequence:
      for iterator_var in sequence:
          statement(s)
	• Example:
  for i in range(1, 5):
      for j in range(i):
          print(i, end=' ')
      print()
Loop Control Statements
	• Continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
	• Break: Exits the loop prematurely.
	• Pass: Does nothing, acts as a placeholder.
Would you like more details on any specific section?
Sure! Here are examples for each type of loop and loop control statement in Python:
While Loop
# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
For Loop
# Example: Print each character in a string
for char in "Python":
    print(char)
Nested Loops
# Example: Print a pattern
for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
Loop Control Statements
	• Continue:
  # Example: Skip even numbers
  for i in range(1, 10):
      if i % 2 == 0:
          continue
      print(i)
	• Break:
  # Example: Stop the loop when a number is found
  for i in range(1, 10):
      if i == 5:
          break
      print(i)
	• Pass:
  # Example: Placeholder for future code
  for i in range(1, 5):
      if i == 3:
          pass  # Do nothing
      else:
          print(i)

		○ list: Ordered collection of items, which can be of different types.
		○ tuple: Ordered and immutable collection of items.
	3. Mapping Type:
		○ dict: Collection of key-value pairs.
	4. Boolean Type:
		○ bool: Represents Boolean values, True or False.
	5. Set Types:
		○ set: Unordered collection of unique items.
		○ frozenset: Immutable version of a set.
	6. Binary Types:
