Summary of Python OOPs Concepts
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a paradigm that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behaviors. Here are the key concepts:
	1. Classes and Objects:
		○ Class: A blueprint for creating objects, defining a set of attributes and methods.
		○ Object: An instance of a class, holding its own data.
	2. Core OOP Principles:
		○ Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class, restricting access to some components.
		○ Inheritance: A class (child) acquires properties and methods of another class (parent).
		○ Polymorphism: Methods with the same name behave differently based on the object’s context.
		○ Abstraction: Hiding internal implementation details while exposing only necessary functionality.
	3. Class and Instance Variables:
		○ Class Variables: Shared across all instances of a class.
		○ Instance Variables: Unique to each instance of a class.
	4. Special Methods:
		○ init: Constructor method, initializes attributes when a new object is created.
		○ self: Reference to the current instance of the class.
	5. Types of Inheritance:
		○ Single Inheritance: Child class inherits from a single parent class.
		○ Multiple Inheritance: Child class inherits from more than one parent class.
		○ Multilevel Inheritance: Child class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another class.
		○ Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
		○ Hybrid Inheritance: Combination of two or more types of inheritance.

Summary of Python Classes and Objects
Classes and Objects:
	• Class: A user-defined template for creating objects, bundling data and functions together.
	• Object: An instance of a class, holding its own data.
Creating a Class:
	• Defined using the class keyword.
	• Example:
  class Dog:
      sound = "bark"  # Class attribute
Creating an Object:
	• An object is an instance of a class.
	• Example:
  dog1 = Dog()
  print(dog1.sound)  # Output: bark
Using __init__() Function:
	• Initializes object attributes when an object is created.
	• Example:
  class Dog:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name  # Instance attribute
          self.age = age  # Instance attribute
Self Parameter:
	• Refers to the current instance of the class, allowing access to its attributes and methods.
	• Example:
  class Dog:
      def bark(self):
          print(f"{self.name} is barking!")
__str__ Method:
	• Provides a custom string representation of an object.
	• Example:
  class Dog:
      def __str__(self):
          return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."
Class and Instance Variables:
	• Class Variables: Shared across all instances of a class.
	• Instance Variables: Unique to each instance.
	• Example:
  class Dog:
      species = "Canine"  # Class variable
      def __init__(self, name, age):
          self.name = name  # Instance variable
          self.age = age  # Instance variable
This page provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing classes and objects in Python, with examples and explanations for each concept.



Summary of Python Objects
Classes and Objects:
	• Class: A user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It bundles data and functionality together.
	• Object: An instance of a class, holding its own data and methods.
Key Concepts:
	1. State: Represented by attributes of an object, reflecting its properties.
	2. Behavior: Represented by methods of an object, reflecting its interactions.
	3. Identity: Provides a unique name to an object, enabling interaction with other objects.
Creating Objects:
	• Instantiation: Creating an object of a class.
	• Example:
  class Dog:
      attr1 = "mammal"
      attr2 = "dog"
def fun(self):
          print("I'm a", self.attr1)
          print("I'm a", self.attr2)
def greet(self):
          print("Hope you are doing well")
# Object instantiation
  Rodger = Dog()
  print(Rodger.attr1)  # Output: mammal
  print(Rodger.attr2)  # Output: dog
  Rodger.fun()         # Output: I'm a mammal, I'm a dog
  Rodger.greet()       # Output: Hope you are doing well

Summary of "self" in Python Classes
Overview:
	• self: Represents the instance of the class being used. It is essential for accessing attributes and methods within the class.
Purpose of "self":
	• Instance Reference: Refers to the current object instance, allowing methods to access and modify the object's attributes.
	• Constructor and Methods: Used as the first parameter in instance methods and the __init__ constructor to initialize and manage object attributes.
Key Concepts:
	1. self in Constructors:
		○ Initializes object attributes.
		○ Example:
 class Subject:
     def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
         self.attr1 = attr1
         self.attr2 = attr2
	2. self in Instance Methods:
		○ Allows methods to operate on the instance's attributes.
		○ Example:
 class Car:
     def show(self):
         print("Model is", self.model)
	3. Not a Keyword:
		○ self is a convention, not a keyword. It can be replaced with any name, but using self is standard practice for readability.
	4. Pointer to Current Object:
		○ self points to the current object, enabling access to its unique attributes and methods.
		○ Example:
 class Check:
     def __init__(self):
         print("Address of self =", id(self))
	5. Modifying Class State:
		○ self allows methods to modify the internal state of an object.
		○ Example: python class Counter: def increment(self): self.count += 1 
This page provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the role and usage of self in Python classes, with examples and explanations for each concept.



Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on Class and Instance Attributes in Python:
Class Attributes
	• Definition: Belong to the class itself and are shared by all instances.
	• Example:
  class SampleClass:
      count = 0  # class attribute
      def increase(self):
          SampleClass.count += 1
Instance Attributes
	• Definition: Unique to each instance and not shared among instances.
	• Example:
  class Emp:
      def __init__(self):
          self.name = 'xyz'
          self.salary = 4000
Functions to List Attributes
	• vars(): Displays instance attributes as a dictionary.
	• dir(): Displays more attributes, including class and ancestor class attributes.

 Encapsulation in Python:
Encapsulation in Python
	• Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some components, protecting the integrity of the data.
How Encapsulation Works
	• Data Hiding: Attributes are kept private or protected, accessible only through methods.
	• Access through Methods: Methods like getters and setters provide controlled access to private attributes.
	• Control and Security: Encapsulation enforces rules on how attributes are accessed or modified.
Types of Members
	• Public Members: Accessible from anywhere.
	• Protected Members: Indicated by a single underscore (_), meant for internal use within the class or its subclasses.
	• Private Members: Indicated by double underscores (__), not accessible directly from outside the class.
Benefits of Encapsulation
	• Controlled Access: Protects data from unintended interference.
	• Data Hiding: Reduces the risk of accidental data modification.
	• Improved Maintenance: Changes to internal implementation do not affect external code.
	• Enhanced Flexibility: Promotes modular design.

 Access Modifiers in Python: Public, Private, and Protected:
Overview
	• Encapsulation: A key principle in object-oriented programming that binds data and methods into a single unit and restricts access to some components.
Types of Access Modifiers
	1. Public:
		○ Definition: Accessible from any part of the program.
		○ Example: 
 class Geek:
     def __init__(self, name, age):
         self.geekName = name  # public attribute
         self.geekAge = age    # public attribute
	2. Protected:
		○ Definition: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
		○ Convention: Prefix with a single underscore (_).
		○ Example:
 class Student:
     _name = None  # protected attribute
	3. Private:
		○ Definition: Accessible only within the class.
		○ Convention: Prefix with double underscores (__).
		○ Example: python class Geek: __name = None # private attribute 
Key Points
	• Data Hiding: Achieved through access modifiers to protect data from unauthorized access.
	• Name Mangling: Python's way of handling private attributes by internally changing their names.

    # protected data member
    _var2 = None

    # private data member
    __var3 = None

    # constructor

        # accessing protected member functions of super class
        self._displayProtectedMembers()

# creating objects of the derived class
obj = Sub("Geeks", 4, "Geeks!")

# calling public member functions of the class
obj.displayPublicMembers()
obj.accessProtectedMembers()
obj.accessPrivateMembers()
print()

# Can also be accessed using
obj._displayProtectedMembers()
obj._Super__displayPrivateMembers()
print()

# Object can access protected member
print("Object is accessing protected member:", obj._var2)
print("Object is accessing private member:", obj._Super__var3)

# object can not access private member, so it will generate Attribute error
# print(obj.__var3)



Name Mangling in Python
Name mangling is a mechanism in Python to protect class-private and subclass-private attributes from being accidentally overridden or accessed. It involves altering the name of the variable in a way that makes it harder to create accidental collisions in subclasses.
How Name Mangling Works
	• Double Leading Underscore: When you prefix an attribute name with double underscores (__), Python changes the name of the attribute in a way that includes the class name. This is done to avoid name conflicts in subclasses.
	• Example:
  class Base:
      def __init__(self):
          self.__private = "I am private"
def get_private(self):
          return self.__private
class Derived(Base):
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()
          self.__private = "I am also private"
obj = Derived()
  print(obj.get_private())  # Output: I am private
  print(obj._Derived__private)  # Output: I am also private
Key Points
	• Name Mangling Format: The attribute __private in class Base is internally changed to _Base__private. Similarly, __private in class Derived is changed to _Derived__private.
	• Accessing Mangled Names: You can still access these attributes using their mangled names, but this is generally discouraged as it breaks the encapsulation principle.
	• Purpose: The main goal is to prevent accidental access and modification of private attributes, especially in inheritance hierarchies.
Benefits
	• Avoids Name Clashes: Helps in avoiding name clashes in subclasses.
	• Encapsulation: Promotes encapsulation by making it harder to access private attributes directly.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on Private Methods in Python:
Private Methods in Python
	• Definition: Private methods are those that should neither be accessed outside the class nor by any base class. They are used to hide the inner functionality of a class from the outside world.
	• Implementation: In Python, private methods are defined by prefixing the method name with double underscores (__).
Example
	• Base Class:
  class Base:
      def fun(self):
          print("Public method")
      def __fun(self):
          print("Private method")
	• Derived Class:
  class Derived(Base):
      def call_public(self):
          self.fun()
      def call_private(self):
          self.__fun()
Name Mangling
	• Purpose: To prevent accidental access and modification of private methods.
	• How it Works: Python changes the name of the private method to include the class name, e.g., __fun becomes _Base__fun.
	• Example:
  class A:
      def __fun(self):
          print("Private method")
  obj = A()
  obj._A__fun()  # Accessing private method using name mangling
Key Points
	• Encapsulation: Private methods help in encapsulating the internal workings of a class.
	• Access Control: They provide controlled access to the class's methods and attributes.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on Protected Variables in Python:
Protected Variables
	• Definition: Variables that can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.
	• Convention: Prefixed with a single underscore (_).
Examples
	1. Within a Class:
   class Geek:
       _name = "R2J"
       _roll = 1706256
       def displayNameAndRoll(self):
           print("Name:", self._name)
           print("Roll:", self._roll)
   obj = Geek()
   obj.displayNameAndRoll()
	• Output: Name: R2J Roll: 1706256 
	1. During Inheritance:
   class Shape:
       def __init__(self, length, breadth):
           self._length = length
           self._breadth = breadth
       def displaySides(self):
           print("Length:", self._length)
           print("Breadth:", self._breadth)
   class Rectangle(Shape):
       def __init__(self, length, breadth):
           super().__init__(length, breadth)
       def calculateArea(self):
           print("Area:", self._length * self._breadth)
   obj = Rectangle(80, 50)
   obj.displaySides()
   obj.calculateArea()
	• Output: Length: 80 Breadth: 50 Area: 4000 
Key Points
	• Access Control: Protected variables are accessible within the class and its derived classes.
	• Encapsulation: Helps in encapsulating the internal state of an object.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on Inheritance in Python:
Overview
	• Inheritance: A fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/base class).
Basic Example
	• Parent Class: Defines common attributes and methods.
  class Animal:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name
      def speak(self):
          pass
	• Child Class: Inherits from the parent class and can override methods.
  class Dog(Animal):
      def speak(self):
          return f"{self.name} barks!"
Key Concepts
	1. Creating a Parent Class: Defines attributes and methods to be inherited.
	2. Creating a Child Class: Inherits and extends the functionality of the parent class.
	3. __init__() Function: Initializes the object's state.
	4. super() Function: Calls the parent class's methods to initialize inherited attributes.
Types of Inheritance
	1. Single Inheritance: One child class inherits from one parent class.
	2. Multiple Inheritance: One child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
	3. Multilevel Inheritance: A class is derived from another derived class.
	4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.
	5. Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of more than one type of inheritance.

# 1. Single Inheritance
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
class Employee(Person):  # Employee inherits from Person
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.salary = salary
# 2. Multiple Inheritance
class Job:
    def __init__(self, salary):
        self.salary = salary
class EmployeePersonJob(Employee, Job):  # Inherits from both Employee and Job
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        Employee.__init__(self, name, salary)  # Initialize Employee
        Job.__init__(self, salary)            # Initialize Job
# 3. Multilevel Inheritance
class Manager(EmployeePersonJob):  # Inherits from EmployeePersonJob
    def __init__(self, name, salary, department):
        EmployeePersonJob.__init__(self, name, salary)  # Explicitly initialize EmployeePersonJob
        self.department = department
# 4. Hierarchical Inheritance
class AssistantManager(EmployeePersonJob):  # Inherits from EmployeePersonJob
    def __init__(self, name, salary, team_size):
        EmployeePersonJob.__init__(self, name, salary)  # Explicitly initialize EmployeePersonJob
        self.team_size = team_size
# 5. Hybrid Inheritance (Multiple + Multilevel)
class SeniorManager(Manager, AssistantManager):  # Inherits from both Manager and AssistantManager
    def __init__(self, name, salary, department, team_size):
        Manager.__init__(self, name, salary, department)        # Initialize Manager
        AssistantManager.__init__(self, name, salary, team_size)  # Initialize AssistantManager
# Creating objects to show inheritance
# Single Inheritance
emp = Employee("John", 40000)
print(emp.name, emp.salary)
# Multiple Inheritance
emp2 = EmployeePersonJob("Alice", 50000)
print(emp2.name, emp2.salary)
# Multilevel Inheritance
mgr = Manager("Bob", 60000, "HR")
print(mgr.name, mgr.salary, mgr.department)
# Hierarchical Inheritance
asst_mgr = AssistantManager("Charlie", 45000, 10)
print(asst_mgr.name, asst_mgr.salary, asst_mgr.team_size)
# Hybrid Inheritance
sen_mgr = SeniorManager("David", 70000, "Finance", 20)
print(sen_mgr.name, sen_mgr.salary, sen_mgr.department, sen_mgr.team_size)
Output
John 40000
Alice 50000
Bob 60000 HR
Charlie 45000 10
David 70000 Finance 20





Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on Method Overriding in Python:
Method Overriding
	• Definition: Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
	• Key Concept: The method in the subclass must have the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the superclass.
Example
	• Basic Example:
  class Parent:
      def show(self):
          print("Inside Parent")
class Child(Parent):
      def show(self):
          print("Inside Child")
obj = Child()
  obj.show()  # Output: Inside Child
Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance
	• Multiple Inheritance: A class derived from more than one base class.
  class Parent1:
      def show(self):
          print("Inside Parent1")
class Parent2:
      def display(self):
          print("Inside Parent2")
class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
      def show(self):
          print("Inside Child")
obj = Child()
  obj.show()  # Output: Inside Child
  obj.display()  # Output: Inside Parent2
	• Multilevel Inheritance: A child and grandchild relationship.
  class Parent:
      def display(self):
          print("Inside Parent")
Calling Parent's Method
	• Using Classname:
  class Parent:
      def show(self):
          print("Inside Parent")
class Child(Parent):
      def show(self):
          Parent.show(self)
          print("Inside Child")
obj = Child()
  obj.show()  # Output: Inside Parent Inside Child
	• Using super():
  class Parent:
      def show(self):
          print("Inside Parent")
class Child(Parent):
      def show(self):
          super().show()
         ("Inside Child")
obj = Child()
  obj.show()  # Output: Inside Parent Inside Child

Sure! Here's a summary of the page on Operator Overloading in Python:
	• Definition: Operator overloading allows giving extended meaning to operators beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example, the + operator can add integers, concatenate strings, and merge lists.
	• Magic Methods: Python provides special functions or magic methods (e.g., __add__, __sub__) that are automatically invoked when associated with particular operators.
	• Example: 
		○ Addition: Overloading the + operator using the __add__ method to add two objects.
		○ Comparison: Overloading comparison operators like >, <, and == using methods like __gt__, __lt__, and __eq__.
	• Boolean Operators: Overloading boolean operators (and, or, not) by defining methods like __and__, __or__, and __not__.
	• Advantages: Improved readability, consistency with built-in types, custom behavior, and enhanced functionality.
Would you like more details on any specific part?

Here's a summary of the page on Python's super() function:
	• Definition: The super() function in Python is used to refer to the parent class or superclass, allowing methods defined in the superclass to be called from the subclass.
	• Syntax: super() returns a proxy object representing the parent class.
	• Example: 
		○ Single Inheritance: Demonstrates how super() is used to call the parent class's __init__ method to initialize inherited attributes.
		○ Multiple Inheritance: Shows how super() can be used in classes that inherit from multiple parent classes.
	• Benefits:
		○ No need to remember or specify the parent class name.
		○ Supports both single and multiple inheritance.
		○ Promotes modularity and code reusability.
		○ Dynamically called due to Python's dynamic nature.
	• Common Use Cases:
		○ Method Overriding: Allows access to the parent class's methods even if overridden in the subclass.
		○ Multi-Level Inheritance: Demonstrates how super() works in multi-level inheritance scenarios.
Would you like more details on any specific part?

Sure! Here are some examples demonstrating the use of the super() function in Python:
Example 1: Single Inheritance
class Parent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
def display(self):
        print(f"Parent Name: {self.name}")
class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent class's __init__ method
        self.age = age
def display(self):
        super().display()  # Call the parent class's display method
        print(f"Child Age: {self.age}")
# Usage
child = Child("John", 12)
child.display()
Output:
Parent Name: John
Child Age: 12
Example 2: Multiple Inheritance
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Class A")
class B:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Class B")
class C(A, B):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  # Calls the __init__ method of class A
        B.__init__(self)    # Explicitly call the __init__ method of class B
# Usage
c = C()
Output:
Class A
Class B
Example 3: Method Overriding
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("Some generic animal sound")
class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        super().sound()  # Call the parent class's sound method
        print("Bark")
# Usage
dog = Dog()
dog.sound()
Output:
Some generic animal sound
Bark
These examples illustrate how super() can be used to call methods from a parent class, supporting both single and multiple inheritance scenarios. Would you like to see more examples or details on any specific part?

The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. It is crucial in the context of multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. Here are the key points:
Definition
	• MRO determines the sequence in which base classes are searched when executing a method.
	• It ensures that each class is only visited once and respects the order of inheritance.
How MRO Works
	• Single Inheritance: The MRO is straightforward, following the inheritance chain from the subclass to the base class.
	• Multiple Inheritance: Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to determine the MRO. This algorithm ensures a consistent and predictable order.
Example
Consider the following class hierarchy:
class A:
    def method(self):
        print("A")
class B(A):
    def method(self):
        print("B")
class C(A):
    def method(self):
        print("C")
class D(B, C):
    pass
d = D()
d.method()
In this example, the MRO for class D would be [D, B, C, A]. When d.method() is called, it follows this order and finds the method in class B.
Viewing MRO
You can view the MRO of a class using the __mro__ attribute or the mro() method:
print(D.__mro__)
print(D.mro())
Both will output: `` (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>) 
Benefits of MRO
	• Predictability: Ensures a consistent method lookup order.
	• Avoids Ambiguity: Prevents conflicts in method resolution in complex inheritance hierarchies.
	• Supports Multiple Inheritance: Efficiently handles method resolution in classes with multiple parents.

Here's a summary of the page on Multiple Inheritance in Python:
Multiple Inheritance
	• Definition: When a class is derived from more than one base class, it is called multiple inheritance. The derived class inherits all features of the base classes.
The Diamond Problem
	• Ambiguity: Occurs when two classes inherit from a common superclass, and a third class inherits from both of these classes. The ambiguity arises in method resolution.
	• Example: Demonstrates how the method resolution order (MRO) resolves this ambiguity.
Method Resolution Order (MRO)
	• Definition: The order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes.
	• Linearization: Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO.
	• Viewing MRO: Use the mro() method or the __mro__ attribute to view the MRO of a class.
The super() Function
	• Usage: Helps in resolving the diamond problem by calling methods from the parent classes in a specific order.
	• Example: Demonstrates how super() is used to call methods from parent classes without ambiguity.
Would you like more details on any specific part?

Sure! Here are some examples demonstrating multiple inheritance and the diamond problem in Python:
Example 1: Diamond Problem
When the method is overridden in both classes:
class Class1:
    def m(self):
        print("In Class1")
class Class2(Class1):
    def m(self):
        print("In Class2")
class Class3(Class1):
    def m(self):
        print("In Class3")
class Class4(Class2, Class3):
    pass
obj = Class4()
obj.m()
Output:
In Class2
If Class4 is declared as Class4(Class3, Class2), the output will be In Class3.
Example 2: Using super() to Resolve Diamond Problem
class Class1:
    def m(self):
        print("In Class1")
class Class2(Class1):
    def m(self):
        print("In Class2")
        super().m()
class Class3(Class1):
    def m(self):
        print("In Class3")
        super().m()
class Class4(Class2, Class3):
    def m(self):
        print("In Class4")
        super().m()
obj = Class4()
obj`
In Class4
In Class2
In Class3
In Class1
This example shows how super() helps in resolving the diamond problem by ensuring each class's method is called in the correct order.

Here's a summary of the page on Hybrid Inheritance in Python:
Hybrid Inheritance
	• Definition: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance. It involves classes derived from multiple base classes, creating a complex inheritance structure.
Syntax
	• Example:
  class BaseClass1:
      # Attributes and methods of BaseClass1
  class BaseClass2:
      # Attributes and methods of BaseClass2
  class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):
      # Attributes and methods of DerivedClass
Examples
	1. Platypus Class:
		○ Classes: Animal, Mammal, Bird, Platypus
		○ Methods: speak(), give_birth(), lay_eggs()
		○ Output:
 Animal speaks
 Mammal gives birth
 Bird lays eggs
	2. Amphibious Vehicle:
		○ Classes: Vehicle, Car, Boat, AmphibiousVehicle
		○ Methods: move(), drive(), sail(), amphibious_action()
		○ Output: Vehicle moves Car drives Boat sails Amphibious vehicle can both drive and sail

Here's a summary of the page on Multilevel Inheritance in Python:
Multilevel Inheritance
	• Definition: Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits from another class, which itself inherits from another class, forming a hierarchy.
Key Concepts
	• Base Class: Represents a broad concept.
	• Intermediate Class: Inherits from the base class and adds specific traits.
	• Derived Class: Inherits from the intermediate class and further specializes.
Examples
	1. Simple Multilevel Inheritance:
		○ Classes: Base, Intermediate, Derived
		○ Attributes: name, roll, role, age
		○ Output:
 The Name is : Lokesh Singh
 The Age is : 21
 The role is : Software Trainer
 The Roll is : 25
	2. Multilevel Inheritance with Method Overriding:
		○ Classes: Shape, Rectangle, Square
		○ Methods: area()
		○ Output: The Area of Rectangle is 12 The Area of Rectangle is 16 
Would you like more details on any specific part?

Sure! Here are some examples demonstrating multilevel inheritance in Python:
Example 1: Simple Multilevel Inheritance
In this example, we have three classes: Base, Intermediate, and Derived. The Intermediate class inherits from the Base class, and the Derived class inherits from the Intermediate class.
class Base:
    def __init__(self, name, roll, role):
        self.name = name
        self.roll = roll
        self.role = role
class Intermediate(Base):
    def __init__(self, age, name, roll, role):
        super().__init__(name, roll, role)
        self.age = age
class Derived(Intermediate):
    def __init__(self, age, name, roll, role):
        super().__init__(age, name, roll, role)
def print_data(self):
        print(f"The Name is: {self.name}")
        print(f"The Age is: {self.age}")
        print(f"The Role is: {self.role}")
        print(f"The Roll is: {self.roll}")
# Creating an object of the Derived class
obj = Derived(21, "Lokesh Singh", 25, "Software Trainer")
obj.print_data()
Output:
The Name is: Lokesh Singh
The Age is: 21
The Role is: Software Trainer
The Roll is: 25
Example 2: Multilevel Inheritance with Method Overriding
In this example, we have three classes: Shape, Rectangle, and Square. The Rectangle class inherits from the Shape class, and the Square class inherits from the Rectangle class. The area method is overridden in the Square class.
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement area()")
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
def area(self):
        print(f"The Area of Rectangle is {self.length * self.width}")
class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, side):
        super().__init__(side, side)
def area(self):
        print(f"The Area of Rectangle is {self.length ** 2}")
# Creating objects of the classes
rect = Rectangle(3, 4)
square = Square(4)
rect.area()
square.area()
Output:
The Area of Rectangle is 12
The Area of Rectangle is 16
