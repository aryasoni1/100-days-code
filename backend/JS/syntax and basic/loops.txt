# JavaScript Loops Summary

Loops execute a block of code multiple times. They are especially useful when working with arrays or objects.

---

## üîÅ Types of Loops in JavaScript

1. **for** - Repeats a block of code a certain number of times.
2. **for/in** - Loops through the properties of an object.
3. **for/of** - Loops through the values of an iterable (arrays, strings, etc.).
4. **while** - Loops as long as a condition is true.
5. **do/while** - Executes the code block once, then repeats as long as the condition is true.

---

## üß± For Loop Structure

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to execute
}
```

- **Expression 1**: Initialization (e.g., `let i = 0`)
- **Expression 2**: Condition (e.g., `i < 5`)
- **Expression 3**: Increment (e.g., `i++`)

All three expressions are optional.

## üí° Examples

### Basic For Loop

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

### Omitting Expressions

```javascript
let i = 0;
for (; i < cars.length; ) {
  text += cars[i];
  i++;
}
```

---

## üß† Loop Scope

- `var` ‚Üí function-scoped; variable accessible outside the loop
- `let` ‚Üí block-scoped; variable limited to the loop

```javascript
let i = 5;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // i is block scoped
}
console.log(i); // Output: 5
```

---

## üß© For/In Loop

- Used for looping through object **properties**.

```javascript
const person = {fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25};
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(person[key]);
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid using `for/in` with arrays if index order is important.

---

## üîÇ For/Of Loop

- Used for looping over **iterables** like arrays, strings.

```javascript
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];
for (let car of cars) {
  console.log(car);
}

let language = "JavaScript";
for (let char of language) {
  console.log(char);
}
```

üìå Not supported in Internet Explorer.

---

## üîÅ Array.forEach()

Calls a function once for each element.

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
numbers.forEach((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});
```

---

## üîÑ While Loop

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

Executes **while the condition is true**.

---

## üîÅ Do/While Loop

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);
```

‚úÖ Executes **at least once**, even if condition is false.

---

## üîÅ For vs While

Both are interchangeable. `for` is cleaner when you know the number of iterations.

```javascript
for (; cars[i];) {
  text += cars[i];
  i++;
}

// Equivalent while loop
while (cars[i]) {
  text += cars[i];
  i++;
}
```
