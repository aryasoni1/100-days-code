# JavaScript Variables Notes

## 📦 Declaring Variables

### Ways to Declare
- Automatically (not recommended)
- Using `var` (legacy)
- Using `let`
- Using `const`

### Example:
```js
x = 5;       // auto-declared
var x = 5;   // old way
let x = 5;   // modern way
const x = 5; // constant
```

> ✅ Best Practice: Always declare variables before using them.

---

## 🔑 When to Use What
1. Always declare variables.
2. Use `const` if the value/type won't change.
3. Use `let` only when reassignment is needed.
4. Use `var` only for old browser support.

---

## 🧠 Identifiers
- Unique names for variables.
- Can contain letters, digits, `_`, `$`.
- Must **not** start with a digit.
- Are **case sensitive**.
- Reserved keywords cannot be used.

```js
let x, _x, $x; // valid
let 1x;        // ❌ invalid
```

---

## ➕ Assignment Operator
- `=` is an assignment operator, **not** equality.
```js
let x = 5;
x = x + 5;  // updates x
```
- Use `==` for equality.

---

## 🧮 Data Types

### Numbers
```js
const pi = 3.14;
```

### Strings
```js
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!';
```

> Numbers in quotes are treated as strings.

---

## 📌 Variable Declaration

### Examples
```js
let carName;             // declaration
carName = "Volvo";       // assignment
let carName = "Volvo";   // declaration + assignment
```

### Output Example
```html
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let carName = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
</script>
```

---

## 📑 Multiple Declarations
```js
let person = "John", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
```

Or:
```js
let person = "John",
    carName = "Volvo",
    price = 200;
```

---

## ❓ Value = undefined
```js
let carName; // carName is undefined
```

---

## ♻️ Re-declaring Variables

- `var` allows re-declaration:
```js
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
```

- `let` and `const` do **not**:
```js
let carName = "Volvo";
let carName;  // ❌ Error
```

---

## ➕ Arithmetic & Strings

### Arithmetic:
```js
let x = 5 + 2 + 3;  // 10
```

### String Concatenation:
```js
let x = "John" + " " + "Doe"; // "John Doe"
```

### Mixed:
```js
let x = "5" + 2 + 3; // "523"
let y = 2 + 3 + "5"; // "55"
```

> 🚨 If a string comes first, rest are treated as strings.

---

## 💲 Dollar Sign `$`
- Valid identifier character.
```js
let $ = "Hello";
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;
```
- Commonly used in **jQuery**.

---

## 🔠 Underscore `_`
- Valid identifier character.
```js
let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;
```
- Often used to indicate **private** variables.
