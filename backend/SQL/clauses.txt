Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL WHERE Clause tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Explains the WHERE clause used to filter records in SQL queries.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, logical operators, and advanced usage of the WHERE clause.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: Basic syntax for the WHERE clause is:
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name operator value;
Practical Examples
	• Basic Filtering: 
  SELECT * FROM Emp1 WHERE Age = 24;
	• Logical Operators: 
  SELECT EmpID, Name, Country FROM Emp1 WHERE Age > 21;
	• BETWEEN Operator: 
  SELECT * FROM Emp1 WHERE Age BETWEEN 22 AND 24;
	• LIKE Operator: 
  SELECT * FROM Emp1 WHERE Name LIKE 'S%';
	• IN Operator: 
  SELECT Name FROM Emp1 WHERE Age IN (21, 23);
Important Points
	• Operators: Various operators like >, <, =, <>, BETWEEN, LIKE, and IN can be used with the WHERE clause.
	• Efficiency: Mastering the WHERE clause is essential for efficient data filtering and query optimization.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL ORDER BY Clause tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Explains the ORDER BY clause used to sort query results in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, and best practices for using the ORDER BY clause.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: Basic syntax for the ORDER BY clause is:
  SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC | DESC;
	• Default Sorting: The default sorting order is ascending (ASC). Use DESC for descending order.
Practical Examples
	• Single Column Sorting: 
  SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY ROLL_NO DESC;
	• Multiple Columns Sorting: 
  SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC, name ASC;
	• Sorting by Column Number: 
  SELECT Roll_no, Name, Address FROM studentinfo ORDER BY 1;
Important Points
	• Multiple Columns: Allows sorting by multiple columns for more complex criteria.
	• Column Numbers: Using column numbers in ORDER BY can impair readability but is supported.
Conclusion
	• Efficiency: The ORDER BY clause is essential for organizing query results and improving readability and performance.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL GROUP BY Clause tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Explains the GROUP BY clause used to organize and summarize data based on identical values in specified columns.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, and advanced use cases with the HAVING clause.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: Basic syntax for the GROUP BY clause is:
  SELECT column1, function_name(column2)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column1, column2;
	• Aggregate Functions: Commonly used with functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().
Practical Examples
	• Single Column Grouping: 
  SELECT name, SUM(sal) FROM emp GROUP BY name;
	• Groups rows with the same name and calculates the sum of sal for each group.
		○ Multiple Columns Grouping: 
  SELECT SUBJECT, YEAR, COUNT(*) FROM Student GROUP BY SUBJECT, YEAR;
	• Groups rows with the same SUBJECT and YEAR.
Advanced Usage
	• HAVING Clause: Used to place conditions on groups.
  SELECT NAME, SUM(sal) FROM Emp GROUP BY name HAVING SUM(sal) > 50000;
	• Filters groups where the total salary exceeds 50,000.
Important Points
	• Placement: GROUP BY is placed after the WHERE clause and before the ORDER BY clause.
	• Conditional Grouping: Use the HAVING clause for conditions on groups, not the WHERE clause.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL LIMIT Clause tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Explains the LIMIT clause used to control the number of rows returned in a query result.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, and practical applications of the LIMIT clause.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: Basic syntax for the LIMIT clause is:
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
  ORDER BY column
  LIMIT [offset,] row_count;
Practical Examples
	• Basic LIMIT Usage: Retrieve a specific number of rows from a table.
  SELECT * FROM student LIMIT 3;
	• LIMIT with ORDER BY: Retrieve the top rows sorted by a specific column.
  SELECT * FROM Student ORDER BY Grade DESC LIMIT 3;
	• LIMIT with OFFSET: Skip a specified number of rows before returning the result set.
  SELECT * FROM Student ORDER BY age LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
Important Points
	• Efficiency: The LIMIT clause helps optimize query performance by restricting the number of rows retrieved.
	• Compatibility: Not all SQL versions support the LIMIT clause; alternatives like OFFSET/FETCH may be used.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL WITH Clause tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Explains the WITH clause, also known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), used to simplify complex SQL queries and improve readability and performance.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, and practical applications of the WITH clause.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: Basic syntax for the WITH clause is:
  WITH temporaryTable AS (
      SELECT column1, column2
      FROM table_name
      WHERE condition
  )
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM temporaryTable
  WHERE condition;
Practical Examples
	• Finding Employees with Above-Average Salary:
  WITH temporaryTable (averageValue) AS (
      SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee
  )
  SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary
  FROM Employee, temporaryTable
  WHERE Employee.Salary > temporaryTable.averageValue;
	• Explanation: Calculates the average salary and retrieves employees with salaries above this average.
		○ Finding Airlines with High Pilot Salaries:
  WITH totalSalary (Airline, total) AS (
      SELECT Airline, SUM(Salary) FROM Pilot GROUP BY Airline
  ),
  airlineAverage (avgSalary) AS (
      SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Pilot
  )
  SELECT Airline
  FROM totalSalary, airlineAverage
  WHERE totalSalary.total > airlineAverage.avgSalary;
	• Explanation: Identifies airlines where the total salary of pilots exceeds the average salary.
Important Points
	• Performance Optimization: The WITH clause helps in performance optimization by allowing the query planner to reuse intermediate results.
	• Readability: Enhances the readability and maintainability of complex SQL queries.
	• Debugging: Simplifies debugging by breaking down complex queries into smaller, manageable parts.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL HAVING Clause tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Explains the HAVING clause used to filter query results based on aggregate functions.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, and differences between HAVING and WHERE clauses.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: Basic syntax for the HAVING clause is:
  SELECT column_name, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column_name
  HAVING condition;
	• Usage: Filters grouped data using Boolean conditions (AND, OR). Must be placed after the GROUP BY clause and before the ORDER BY clause (if used).
Practical Examples
	1. Filtering Aggregated Results:
   SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS Salary
   FROM Employee
   GROUP BY Department
   HAVING SUM(Salary) >= 50000;
	1. Multiple Conditions:
   SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS Total_Salary, AVG(Salary) AS Average_Salary
   FROM Employee
   GROUP BY Department
   HAVING SUM(Salary) >= 50000 AND AVG(Salary) > 55000;
	1. Using COUNT():
   SELECT Department, COUNT(EmployeeId) AS Employee_Count
   FROM Employee
   GROUP BY Department
   HAVING COUNT(EmployeeId) >= 2;
	1. Using AVG():
   SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS Average_Salary
   FROM Employee
   GROUP BY Department
   HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
Important Points
	• Difference from WHERE: HAVING filters groups after aggregation, while WHERE filters individual rows before grouping.
	• Aggregate Functions: Commonly used with SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), and MIN().
