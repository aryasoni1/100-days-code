Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL Rename Database tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Provides a comprehensive guide on renaming databases in SQL-based DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, best practices, and troubleshooting for renaming databases.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: 
		○ SQL Server: ALTER DATABASE [current_database_name] MODIFY NAME = [new_database_name];
		○ MySQL: RENAME DATABASE [current_database_name] TO [new_database_name];
	• Example: Renaming a database from "Test" to "Example" using the appropriate command for the DBMS.
Important Considerations
	• Database Availability: Renaming may temporarily render the database inaccessible.
	• Dependencies: Update any applications, scripts, or users relying on the database name.
	• Permissions: Ensure you have administrative or root-level access.
	• Backups: Create a backup before renaming to mitigate data loss risks.
Troubleshooting
	• Database in Use: Disconnect active users or close applications connected to the database.
	• Insufficient Privileges: Ensure you have the necessary permissions.
	• Database Name Constraints: Adhere to naming conventions and avoid restricted characters or reserved words.
Conclusion
	• Best Practices: Follow proper syntax and best practices to avoid errors.
	• Precautions: Use the command with caution due to its irreversible nature.
This tutorial is essential for understanding how to safely and effectively rename databases in SQL. If you need more details on any specific section, feel free to ask!

Sure! Here are examples and code snippets for renaming a database in different SQL-based DBMS:
SQL Server
To rename a database from "Test" to "Example":
ALTER DATABASE Test MODIFY NAME = Example;
MySQL
To rename a database from "Test" to "Example" (Note: MySQL does not support direct renaming of databases, so you need to create a new database and copy the data):
CREATE DATABASE Example;
RENAME TABLE Test.table1 TO Example.table1;
RENAME TABLE Test.table2 TO Example.table2;
-- Repeat for all tables in the database
DROP DATABASE Test;
PostgreSQL
To rename a database from "Test" to "Example":
ALTER DATABASE Test RENAME TO Example;
Important Considerations
	• Database Availability: Renaming may temporarily render the database inaccessible.
	• Dependencies: Update any applications, scripts, or users relying on the database name.
	• Permissions: Ensure you have administrative or root-level access.

	• Example: Selecting a database named "GeeksForGeeks" using USE GeeksForGeeks;.
Querying Data
	• SELECT Statement: Used to query and retrieve data from tables within the selected database.
		○ Basic SELECT: SELECT * FROM employees; retrieves all columns and rows.
		○ Specific Columns: SELECT name, age FROM employees; retrieves specific columns.
		○ Filtering: SELECT name, age FROM employees WHERE age >= 35; filters results.
		○ Sorting: SELECT name, age FROM employees ORDER BY age DESC; sorts results.
		○ Limiting: SELECT name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3; limits results.
		○ Aggregating: SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department; aggregates data.
Important Points
	• Database Selection: Essential for specifying the database to be used for storing and querying data.
	• Error Handling: If no database is selected, an error will occur.
	• Best Practices: Follow syntax and best practices to avoid errors and ensure efficient database operations.
This tutorial is essential for understanding how to select and query databases in SQL. If you need more details on any specific section, feel free to ask!

Sure! Here are examples and code snippets for selecting a database and querying data in SQL:
Selecting a Database
To select a database named "GeeksForGeeks":
USE GeeksForGeeks;
