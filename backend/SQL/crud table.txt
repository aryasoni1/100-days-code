Sure! Here's a brief summary of the SQL CREATE TABLE tutorial page:
Overview
	• Purpose: Provides a comprehensive guide on creating tables in SQL-based DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
	• Key Topics: Syntax, examples, best practices, and troubleshooting for using the CREATE TABLE command.
Key Concepts
	• Syntax: Basic syntax for creating a table is:
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype(size),
      column2 datatype(size),
      ...
      columnN datatype(size)
  );
	• Example: Creating a table named "Customer" with columns for CustomerID, CustomerName, LastName, Country, Age, and Phone.
Practical Examples
	• Creating a Table: 
  CREATE TABLE Customer(
      CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      CustomerName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      Country VARCHAR(50),
      Age INT CHECK (Age >= 0 AND Age <= 99),
      Phone INT(10)
  );
	• Inserting Data: 
  INSERT INTO Customer (CustomerID, CustomerName, LastName, Country, Age, Phone)
  VALUES (1, 'Shubham', 'Thakur', 'India', 23, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
         (2, 'Aman', 'Chopra', 'Australia', 21, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
         (3, 'Naveen', 'Tulasi', 'Sri Lanka', 24, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
         (4, 'Aditya', 'Arpan', 'Austria', 21, 'xxxxxxxxxx'),
         (5, 'Nishant', 'Jain', 'Spain', 22, 'xxxxxxxxxx');
Advanced Usage
	• Creating a Table from Another Table: 
  CREATE TABLE SubTable AS
  SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customer;
Important Points
	• Constraints: Use constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and DEFAULT to ensure data integrity.
	• Avoiding Errors: Use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS to avoid errors if the table already exists.
Conclusion
	• Best Practices: Follow proper syntax and best practices to create well-structured tables.
	• Troubleshooting: Address common errors and ensure efficient database operations.

Retrieve Specific Columns
To retrieve the "CustomerName" and "LastName" columns from the "Customer" table:
SELECT CustomerName, LastName FROM Customer;
Retrieve All Columns
To retrieve all columns from the "Customer" table:
SELECT * FROM Customer;
Using WHERE Clause
To retrieve the names of customers who are 21 years old:
SELECT CustomerName FROM Customer WHERE Age = 21;
Using GROUP BY Clause
To count the number of items ordered by each customer (assuming an "Orders" table):
SELECT COUNT(item), Customer_id FROM Orders GROUP BY order_id;
Using HAVING Clause
To retrieve departments with a total salary of at least 50,000 (assuming an "employee" table):
SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS Salary FROM employee GROUP BY Department HAVING SUM(Salary) >= 50000;
Using ORDER BY Clause
To retrieve all customer records sorted by age in descending order:
SELECT * FROM Customer ORDER BY Age DESC;
