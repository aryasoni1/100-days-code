# üìä Indexes & Performance in SQL

Indexes play a crucial role in optimizing query performance by reducing the time it takes to retrieve data from a database. Understanding different types of indexes and how to use them can greatly improve the speed of your SQL queries.

## üè∑Ô∏è Indexes in SQL

An **index** is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space and maintenance overhead. Indexes are created on columns that are frequently queried or used in join conditions.

### Types of Indexes

1. **Single-Column Indexes**: Indexes created on a single column.
2. **Composite Indexes**: Indexes created on multiple columns.
3. **Full-Text Indexes**: Specialized indexes for searching text-based columns.
4. **Unique Indexes**: Ensures the uniqueness of values in a column (often created automatically for primary keys).
5. **Clustered Indexes**: The physical storage of the table rows is ordered according to the index.

## üèóÔ∏è B-Tree Indexing

Most relational databases use **B-Tree** (Balanced Tree) indexing. B-Tree indexes are designed to be efficient for range queries, equality searches, and sorting.

* **Structure**: A B-Tree index stores keys in a balanced tree structure, where the root and intermediate nodes point to child nodes, making data retrieval faster.
* **Performance**: B-Tree indexing ensures logarithmic time complexity for queries, making them much faster than full-table scans for large datasets.
* **Use Cases**: Perfect for equality and range queries (`<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`).

### Example: Creating a B-Tree Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees (name);
```

## üóùÔ∏è Composite Indexes

A **composite index** is an index on multiple columns. It is useful when queries often filter or join on more than one column at a time. The order of columns in a composite index is crucial, as the index is most effective when queries use the first column in the index.

### Example: Creating a Composite Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name_department ON employees (name, department);
```

This index would speed up queries that filter or sort by both `name` and `department`.

### Performance Considerations

* **Ordering**: A composite index is used most efficiently when queries use the first column in the index. If your query only uses the second or third column, the index might not be used.
* **Maintenance Cost**: Composite indexes are larger and can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations because the index needs to be updated.

## üîç Query Plan Analysis

SQL databases provide the ability to **explain** or **analyze** the query execution plan. This allows developers to understand how queries are executed, which indexes are used, and where improvements can be made.

### Example: Viewing Query Execution Plan

In **MySQL**:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 50000;
```

In **PostgreSQL**:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND salary > 50000;
```

The execution plan will show you:

* **Indexes** used in the query.
* **Scan methods** (e.g., full-table scan or index scan).
* **Join methods** (e.g., nested loop join, hash join).
* **Cost** of executing the query, which helps in identifying bottlenecks.

## üö´ Avoiding Full-Table Scans

A **full-table scan** occurs when the database has to read all rows in a table to satisfy a query. This is inefficient and slow, especially for large tables.

### How to Avoid Full-Table Scans

1. **Use Indexes**: Create indexes on columns that are frequently queried. This avoids full-table scans and speeds up data retrieval.

   * Example: If you frequently search for employees by their department, index the `department` column.

2. **Filter Efficiently**: Use indexes on columns involved in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

   * Example: `WHERE department = 'Sales'` can benefit from an index on `department`.

3. **Limit Returned Rows**: Use `LIMIT` or `TOP` clauses to limit the number of rows returned by a query. This reduces the work needed by the database.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Avoid Redundant Joins**: Sometimes queries join tables unnecessarily or redundantly. This increases the cost of the query and may result in a full-table scan.

## üîÑ Redundant Joins

Redundant joins occur when you join the same table multiple times or join tables in an inefficient way. These can increase query complexity and execution time.

### How to Avoid Redundant Joins

1. **Use Proper Join Conditions**: Ensure that joins are only made when necessary and that the join condition is accurate.

2. **Eliminate Unnecessary Joins**: If you don‚Äôt need data from a table in the result set, avoid joining it.

   * Example: If you're querying employee names and salaries, there's no need to join the department table unless you need department data.

3. **Check for Duplicate Data**: Sometimes, queries unintentionally produce duplicate data due to redundant joins. You can use `DISTINCT` or adjust your join logic to resolve this.

## üöÄ Index Optimization Tips

* **Selectivity**: Indexes work best on columns with high selectivity (columns with many unique values).
* **Index Size**: Be mindful of the size of your indexes. Over-indexing can lead to performance degradation due to overhead.
* **Composite Indexes**: Only create composite indexes when needed. Indexes on frequently queried column pairs or sets can significantly improve query performance.
* **Covering Index**: A covering index includes all the columns that a query needs, allowing the database to satisfy the query using the index alone, without accessing the table.

---

## üîë Key Takeaways

* **Indexes** speed up query performance but can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.
* **B-Tree indexes** are the default and work well for range and equality queries.
* **Composite indexes** are useful for queries that filter or sort on multiple columns.
* **Query Plan Analysis** helps identify inefficiencies like missing indexes or full-table scans.
* Avoid **full-table scans** by using appropriate indexes and limiting the number of rows returned.
* Eliminate **redundant joins** by ensuring your query logic is correct and efficient.
