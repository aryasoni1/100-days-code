# ðŸ“Š What is SQL?

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with **relational databases**. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data stored in structured tables.

## ðŸ§± Relational Databases vs NoSQL

| Feature             | Relational Databases (SQL)                          | NoSQL Databases                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Structure**  | Tables with rows and columns                        | Key-value, Document, Graph, Column     |
| **Schema**          | Fixed schema (strong typing)                        | Flexible schema                        |
| **Query Language**  | SQL                                                 | Varies (MongoDB uses JSON-like syntax) |
| **ACID Compliance** | Yes (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Often eventually consistent            |
| **Use Case**        | Structured data, financial systems                  | Unstructured/rapidly changing data     |

**Examples:**

* SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MSSQL
* NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Firebase

## ðŸ§© Popular SQL Engines

### 1. **MySQL**

* Open-source and widely used.
* Great for web applications (LAMP stack).
* Good performance and scalability.

### 2. **PostgreSQL**

* Advanced open-source database.
* Emphasizes standards compliance and extensibility.
* Supports complex queries, JSON, and custom data types.

### 3. **SQLite**

* Serverless, self-contained, file-based DB.
* Lightweight and used in mobile apps or small projects.
* Zero configuration required.

### 4. **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**

* Developed by Microsoft.
* Enterprise-grade with integration into .NET ecosystem.
* Good GUI support via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## âœ… Summary

* SQL is essential for working with structured data in relational databases.
* Relational DBs are reliable and ACID-compliant, great for critical systems.
* SQL engines vary in complexity, use case, and scalability.
