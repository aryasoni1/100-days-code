Sure! Here's a summary of the page on SQL Aggregate Functions:
SQL Aggregate Functions Overview
	• Purpose: Perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value.
	• Common Functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX().
	• Usage: Often used with the GROUP BY clause to summarize data.
Detailed Functions and Examples
	1. COUNT():
		○ COUNT(*): Total number of records.
		○ COUNT(column): Number of non-null values in a column.
		○ COUNT(DISTINCT column): Number of distinct non-null values.
	2. SUM():
		○ SUM(column): Sum of all non-null values in a column.
		○ SUM(DISTINCT column): Sum of distinct non-null values.
	3. AVG():
		○ AVG(column): Average of all non-null values.
		○ AVG(DISTINCT column): Average of distinct non-null values.
	4. MIN():
		○ MIN(column): Minimum value in a column.
	5. MAX():
		○ MAX(column): Maximum value in a column.
Practical Examples
	• Example queries using an Employee table to demonstrate each function.
	• Use of GROUP BY to perform aggregate calculations on grouped data.
	• Use of HAVING clause to filter results after applying aggregate functions.
Key Takeaways
	• Aggregate functions operate on groups of values and return a single result.
	• Commonly used with the GROUP BY clause for summarizing data.
	• Operate on non-null values only (except for COUNT).
This page provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and using SQL aggregate functions effectively.

Summary of SQL COUNT(), AVG(), and SUM() Functions
Overview:
	• Purpose: Perform mathematical analysis on data.
	• Functions: COUNT(), AVG(), SUM().
Functions Explained:
	1. COUNT():
		○ Counts rows matching a condition.
		○ Syntax: SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
	2. AVG():
		○ Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
		○ Syntax: SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
	3. SUM():
		○ Computes the total sum of a numeric column.
		○ Syntax: SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Examples:
	• COUNT(): SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM GeeksTab; → Output: 7
	• AVG(): SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM GeeksTab; → Output: 6300
	• SUM(): SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM GeeksTab; → Output: 44100
Key Points:
	• Essential for data analysis and reporting.
	• Handle NULL values carefully.
	• Often used with WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses.
Conclusion:
	• Mastering these functions enhances SQL's potential in reporting and data analysis.

Summary of SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
Overview:
	• Purpose: Extract minimum and maximum values from a specified column.
	• Functions: MIN(), MAX().
Functions Explained:
	1. MIN():
		○ Returns the smallest value in a column.
		○ Syntax: SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
	2. MAX():
		○ Returns the largest value in a column.
		○ Syntax: SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Examples:
	• MIN(): SELECT MIN(Age) FROM Customer; → Output: 21
	• MAX(): SELECT MAX(Age) FROM Customer; → Output: 24
Usage with Other Columns:
	• Fetching names with minimum age: SELECT CustomerName, MIN(Age) AS min_age FROM Customer;
	• Using in HAVING clause: SELECT CustomerName, MAX(Age) AS max_age FROM Customer HAVING MIN(Age) > 22;
Key Points:
	• Operate on various data types: numbers, strings, dates.
	• Can be combined with other SQL clauses like GROUP BY and HAVING.
	• Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
Conclusion:
	• MIN() and MAX() functions are powerful tools for extracting the lowest and highest values from a dataset, enhancing data analysis capabilities.
