Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on SQL NOT NULL Constraint:
Overview
	• Purpose: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values, maintaining data integrity by enforcing mandatory fields.
Key Points
	1. Definition: The NOT NULL constraint ensures that a column must always contain a value.
	2. Syntax:
   CREATE TABLE table_Name (
       column1 data_type(size) NOT NULL,
       column2 data_type(size) NOT NULL,
       ...
   );
	3. Usage:
		○ During Table Creation: Add NOT NULL constraints when creating a table.
		○ Using ALTER Table: Add NOT NULL constraints to existing tables. sql ALTER TABLE Emp MODIFY Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL; 
Advantages
	• Prevents Data Gaps: Ensures completeness of data.
	• Enforces Business Logic: Makes certain fields mandatory.
	• Improves Data Integrity: Ensures critical data is always present.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on SQL UNIQUE Constraint:
Overview
	• Purpose: Ensures all values in a column (or combination of columns) are distinct, preventing duplicate entries.
Key Points
	1. Definition: The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column or a set of columns are different from one another.
	2. Syntax:
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column1 datatype UNIQUE,
       column2 datatype,
       ...
   );
	1. Usage:
		○ During Table Creation: Add UNIQUE constraints when creating a table.
		○ Using ALTER Table: Add UNIQUE constraints to existing tables. sql ALTER TABLE Emp MODIFY Name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE; 
Examples
	1. Single Column:
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
   );
	1. Multiple Columns:
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerID INT,
       ProductID INT,
       UNIQUE (CustomerID, ProductID)
   );
Important Points
	• Prevents Duplicate Values: Ensures no two rows have the same value in the specified column(s).
	• Allows NULL Values: Unlike PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE allows multiple NULL values.
	• Flexibility: Can be applied to one or more columns and added using ALTER TABLE.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on SQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint:
Overview
	• Purpose: Ensures data integrity by uniquely identifying each record in a table, preventing duplicate or NULL values.
Key Points
	1. Definition: A primary key is a column (or group of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
	2. Properties:
		○ Must contain unique values.
		○ Cannot have NULL values.
		○ Only one primary key per table, but it can consist of multiple columns (composite key).
Syntax
	• CREATE TABLE:
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype constraint,
      column2 datatype constraint,
      ...
      CONSTRAINT pk_constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2, ...)
  );
	• ALTER TABLE:
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2, ...);
Examples
	1. Creating a Primary Key:
   CREATE TABLE Persons (
       PersonID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
       LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
       FirstName varchar(255),
       Age int
   );
	1. Adding a Primary Key to an Existing Table:
   ALTER TABLE Persons
   ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (PersonID);
Benefits
	• Data Integrity: Ensures each record is unique.
	• Efficient Querying: Improves query performance by creating an index.
	• Referential Integrity: Establishes relationships between tables, reducing data redundancy and improving consistency.

Common Issues and Best Practices for Primary Keys
	1. Avoid NULL Values:
		○ Ensure columns involved in the primary key do not accept NULL values to maintain data integrity.
	2. Choose Meaningful Primary Keys:
		○ Select a primary key that naturally fits the data and serves as a meaningful identifier, such as an ID field.
	3. Composite Keys:
		○ Be cautious when using composite keys. They can make queries more complex.
		○ If possible, use a simple key or generate an artificial primary key (like an ID).
	4. Changing Primary Keys:
		○ Once a primary key is established, changing it can be difficult due to interdependencies with other tables (foreign key constraints).
		○ Always plan ahead when designing your database schema to avoid complications.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint:
Overview
	• Purpose: Ensures data integrity by enforcing relationships between tables, maintaining consistent and valid data across the database.
Key Points
	1. Definition: A FOREIGN KEY is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key columns of another table.
	2. Syntax:
		○ CREATE TABLE: sql CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ... CONSTRAINT fk_constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (column1, column2, ...) REFERENCES parent_table(column1, column2, ...) ); 
		○ ALTER TABLE: sql ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT fk_constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (column1, column2, ...) REFERENCES parent_table(column1, column2, ...); 
Examples
	1. Creating Foreign Key:
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       OrderNumber INT NOT NULL,
       CustomerID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
   );
	1. Inserting Values:
		○ If a corresponding value in the foreign table doesn’t exist, an error occurs. sql INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, OrderNumber, CustomerID) VALUES (4, 104, 4); 
			§ Output: Error: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed.
Important Points
	• Referential Integrity: Ensures that the relationship between tables is consistent.
	• Multiple Constraints: A table can have multiple FOREIGN KEY constraints.
	• ON DELETE and ON UPDATE: Specifies actions when a referenced row is deleted or updated.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on Composite Key in SQL:
Overview
	• Definition: A composite key is a primary key made up of two or more columns to uniquely identify records in a table.
	• Purpose: Ensures uniqueness when individual columns cannot guarantee it.
Key Points
	1. Formation: Combines multiple columns to form a unique identifier.
	2. Uniqueness: Ensures that the combined values of the columns are unique.
	3. No NULL Values: Columns involved in a composite key cannot be NULL.
Example
	• Creating a Table with Composite Key:
  CREATE TABLE student (
      rollNumber INT,
      name VARCHAR(30),
      class VARCHAR(30),
      section VARCHAR(1),
      mobile VARCHAR(10),
      PRIMARY KEY (rollNumber, mobile)
  );
Usage
	• When to Use: Useful when a single column cannot uniquely identify a row, but a combination of columns can.
	• Data Integrity: Helps maintain data integrity by ensuring unique combinations of columns.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on SQL Alternate Key:
Overview
	• Definition: An alternate key is any candidate key not selected as the primary key. It is a set of candidate keys other than the primary key.
Key Points
	1. Primary Key vs. Alternate Key:
		○ Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row in a table, cannot contain NULL values.
		○ Alternate Key: Also unique but not chosen as the primary key, can contain NULL values.
	2. Candidate Keys:
		○ A table can have multiple candidate keys.
		○ The database administrator selects one as the primary key, and the rest become alternate keys.
	3. Properties:
		○ Must be unique.
		○ Can be a single attribute or a combination of attributes.
		○ Cannot be a foreign key.
Example
	• Customer Information Table:
		○ Primary Key: Customer ID
		○ Alternate Keys: PAN Number, Email Address
Creating an Alternate Key
	• Using UNIQUE Constraint:
  CREATE TABLE Customer (
      CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
      PAN VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE
  );

Key Differences Between Primary Key and Alternate Key
Feature	Primary Key	Alternate Key
Uniqueness	Must be unique	Must be unique
Null Values	Cannot contain NULL values	Can contain NULL values
Use	Used to identify each row uniquely	An alternate option for uniqueness
Relationship with Candidate Key	The selected candidate key	Other candidate keys not selected as primary
Number of Keys	One primary key per table	Multiple alternate keys possible

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on SQL CHECK Constraint:
Overview
	• Purpose: Ensures that the values in a column meet specified conditions, maintaining domain integrity.
Key Points
	1. Definition: The CHECK constraint limits the range or set of values that can be inserted into a column.
	2. Syntax:
   CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column1 datatype,
       column2 datatype CHECK (condition),
       ...
   );
Examples
	1. Single Column:
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(50),
       Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18 AND Age <= 120)
   );
	1. Multiple Columns:
   CREATE TABLE Employee (
       EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(50),
       Age INT,
       Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
       CHECK (Age >= 18 AND Salary > 0)
   );
Best Practices
	• Be Specific with Conditions: Ensure conditions are clear to avoid errors.
	• Use Logical Operators: Combine multiple conditions using AND, OR, and NOT.
	• Test Constraints: Test in a development environment before applying to production.
	• Database Support: Check documentation for specific database versions.

Sure! Here's a brief summary of the page on SQL DEFAULT Constraint:
Overview
	• Purpose: Ensures that a column has a default value when no value is specified during an INSERT operation, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
Key Points
	1. Automatic Value Insertion: If no value is provided, the default value is automatically inserted.
	2. Simplifies Data Entry: Reduces the need to specify values for every column in an INSERT statement.
	3. Optional: Not all columns require a default value.
	4. Applicable to Any Data Type: Can be used with numbers, dates, strings, etc.
	5. Not for NULL Values: Cannot assign NULL as a default value.
Syntax
	• CREATE TABLE:
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype DEFAULT default_value,
      column2 datatype DEFAULT default_value,
      ...
  );
Example
	• Creating a Table with DEFAULT Constraint:
  CREATE TABLE Geeks (
      ID INT NOT NULL,
      Name VARCHAR(255),
      Age INT,
      Location VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Noida'
  );
Dropping the DEFAULT Constraint
	• Syntax:
  ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name DROP DEFAULT;
