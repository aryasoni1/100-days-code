Here's a brief summary of the page on Static Files in Flask:
Static Files Overview
	• Purpose: Static files include CSS, JavaScript, and images that are served directly to the client.
	• Default Folder: Flask looks for static files in a folder named static located in the root directory of your application.
Serving Static Files
	• URL Access: Static files are accessible via the /static URL prefix.
	• Example: A file static/style.css can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:5000/static/style.css.
Generating URLs
	• url_for(): Use url_for('static', filename='style.css') to generate URLs for static files, ensuring flexibility and correctness.
Best Practices
	• Organize Files: Keep your static files organized in subdirectories (e.g., static/css, static/js).
	• Caching: Use caching strategies to improve performance and reduce load times for static files.
This section guides you through managing and serving static files in a Flask application, ensuring a structured and efficient approach.
