Here’s your beginner-friendly, Markdown-formatted note on **Data Modeling** in MongoDB:

# 📂 MongoDB Data Modeling

## 🧾 What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of **structuring your documents and collections** based on how your app queries and uses data. In MongoDB, this is flexible thanks to its document-based, NoSQL nature.

## 🧱 Embedding vs Referencing

### 🧩 **Embedding (Denormalization)**

Embed related data **inside a single document**.

```js
{
  name: "Alice",
  orders: [
    { product: "Book", quantity: 2 },
    { product: "Pen", quantity: 5 }
  ]
}
```

✅ Pros:

* Fewer joins
* Faster reads

⚠️ Cons:

* Document size limit (16MB)
* Data duplication

---

### 🔗 **Referencing (Normalization)**

Store related data in **separate collections** and use IDs to link.

```js
// users
{ _id: 1, name: "Bob" }

// orders
{ userId: 1, product: "Laptop", quantity: 1 }
```

✅ Pros:

* Avoids data duplication
* Scales well for complex relationships

⚠️ Cons:

* Requires multiple queries (joins in code)

## ⚖️ Normalization vs Denormalization

| Approach            | Description                              | Use When…                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Normalization**   | Splitting data into multiple collections | You need to **avoid duplication** and data changes frequently |
| **Denormalization** | Embedding related data into one document | You prioritize **read speed** and data changes are rare       |

## 🧠 Schema Design Patterns

### 🪣 1. **Bucket Pattern**

Group related items into a single document (good for time-series or logs).

```js
{
  userId: 1,
  month: "2025-05",
  logins: [ "2025-05-01", "2025-05-04", "2025-05-10" ]
}
```

✅ Reduces number of documents
✅ Good for aggregation

---

### 📉 2. **Outlier Pattern**

Handle documents that occasionally exceed size/complexity by storing large parts separately.

```js
{
  _id: 1,
  title: "Blog Post",
  summary: "Short content",
  fullTextId: ObjectId("...")
}
```

✅ Keeps most documents small
✅ Efficient for common reads

---

### 🎯 3. **Subset Pattern**

Embed only a **subset** of related data to improve read performance.

```js
{
  name: "Product A",
  recentReviews: [
    { user: "Tom", rating: 5 },
    { user: "Jane", rating: 4 }
  ]
}
```

✅ Faster access to most-used data
⚠️ Full reviews stored separately if needed

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept             | Description                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Embedding**       | Store related data inside the same doc    |
| **Referencing**     | Link to related data in other collections |
| **Normalization**   | Separate collections for clean structure  |
| **Denormalization** | Combine related data for performance      |
| **Design Patterns** | Optimize for real-world access patterns   |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* Model **based on your access patterns**, not just relationships.
* Avoid deeply nested structures — they can be hard to update.
* Use **embedding** when you read related data together.
* Use **referencing** when related data changes independently or is large.
* Benchmark and test your schema under **realistic workloads**.
