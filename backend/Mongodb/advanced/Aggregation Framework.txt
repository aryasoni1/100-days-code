Here’s a clear and beginner-friendly `.md` formatted note on the **MongoDB Aggregation Framework**:

# 📊 **Aggregation Framework in MongoDB**

> Aggregation allows you to **transform, analyze, and summarize** your data — perfect for dashboards, reports, and analytics.

---

## 🔧 **What is Aggregation?**

Aggregation is like a **data pipeline**. It processes documents step by step using **stages** like `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, etc.

---

## 🔁 **Pipeline Stages Overview**

### 🧱 Basic Stages:

| Stage      | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `$match`   | Filters documents (like `find`)              |
| `$group`   | Groups documents and performs aggregations   |
| `$sort`    | Sorts results                                |
| `$project` | Reshapes documents, includes/excludes fields |
| `$lookup`  | Joins data from another collection           |

---

## 🔍 **Example: Basic Pipeline**

```js
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "delivered" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $sort: { total: -1 } }
])
```

> 🔹 This filters for delivered orders, groups by customer, sums their orders, and sorts by total.

---

## 🛠️ **Project Stage Example**

```js
{ $project: { name: 1, total: { $multiply: ["$price", "$quantity"] } } }
```

* Include `name`, and calculate a new `total` field.

---

## 🔗 **Join with `$lookup`**

```js
{
  $lookup: {
    from: "users",
    localField: "userId",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "userDetails"
  }
}
```

> Similar to a SQL join — enriches one collection with data from another.

---

## 📊 **Common Use Cases**

* 📈 Dashboards: total revenue, top customers, sales by category
* 🧾 Reports: product popularity, user activity logs
* 🔄 Data transformation: reshape documents before saving or exporting

## ✅ Summary

| Operator   | Use For                         |

| `$group`   | Aggregating values              |
| `$sort`    | Sorting results                 |
| `$project` | Transforming document structure |
| `$lookup`  | Joining collections             |
