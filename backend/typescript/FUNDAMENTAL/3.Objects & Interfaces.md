Here's a detailed breakdown of **Objects & Interfaces** in TypeScript:

---

## 🧱 **Objects & Interfaces in TypeScript**

### 🧩 **1. Object Typing**

You can annotate object shapes directly:

```ts
const user: { name: string; age: number } = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};
```

But it's better to use **interfaces or type aliases** for reuse.

---

### 🧾 **2. Interfaces**

Interfaces define the shape of an object:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

Usage:

```ts
const user: User = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};
```

---

### ✨ **3. Optional & Readonly Properties**

* **Optional** (`?`) properties:

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age?: number; // Optional
}
```

* **Readonly** properties:

```ts
interface User {
  readonly id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

### 🆚 **4. Interfaces vs. Type Aliases**

| Feature                            | `interface`        | `type`                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Extending                          | Supports `extends` | Use `&` (intersection) |
| Declaration merging                | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No                   |
| Complex types (e.g., union, tuple) | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                  |

**Example with `type`:**

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

---

### ➕ **5. Intersection Types (`&`)**

Combine multiple types:

```ts
type Person = { name: string };
type Worker = { job: string };

type Employee = Person & Worker;

const dev: Employee = {
  name: "John",
  job: "Engineer",
};
```

---

### 🚦 **6. Union Types (`|`)**

A variable can be one of several types:

```ts
type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error";

function handle(status: Status) {
  if (status === "success") {
    console.log("Done!");
  }
}
```

Would you like to go into **generics**, **type guards**, or **classes with interfaces** next?
