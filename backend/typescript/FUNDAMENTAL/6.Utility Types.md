Here’s a quick reference to **TypeScript Utility Types**, which let you transform types easily without rewriting boilerplate:

---

## 🧰 **Common TypeScript Utility Types**

---

### 🔹 `Partial<T>`

Makes all properties in `T` optional.

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const updateUser = (user: Partial<User>) => {
  // user can have { id } or { name } or both
};
```

---

### 🔹 `Required<T>`

Opposite of `Partial` – makes all properties **required**.

```ts
interface Config {
  theme?: string;
}

const defaultConfig: Required<Config> = {
  theme: "dark"  // now `theme` must be provided
};
```

---

### 🔹 `Pick<T, K>`

Creates a type by picking a subset of properties `K` from type `T`.

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

type UserPreview = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;
```

---

### 🔹 `Omit<T, K>`

Creates a type by omitting properties `K` from type `T`.

```ts
type UserNoEmail = Omit<User, "email">;
```

---

### 🔹 `Record<K, T>`

Constructs a type with keys `K` of type `T`.

```ts
type Role = "admin" | "user";

const permissions: Record<Role, string[]> = {
  admin: ["read", "write"],
  user: ["read"]
};
```

---

### 🔹 `Readonly<T>`

Makes all properties of `T` immutable (read-only).

```ts
const user: Readonly<User> = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@example.com"
};

// user.name = "Bob"; ❌ Error – cannot assign to a read-only property
```
