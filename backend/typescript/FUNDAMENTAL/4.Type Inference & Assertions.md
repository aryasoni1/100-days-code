Here's a detailed explanation of **Type Inference & Assertions** in TypeScript:

---

## üß† **Type Inference & Assertions in TypeScript**

### üîç **1. Type Inference**

TypeScript can **automatically infer** the type of a variable based on its value:

```ts
let message = "Hello World"; // inferred as `string`
let count = 42;              // inferred as `number`
```

You don't always need to explicitly annotate types unless you want to enforce them.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Type Assertions**

Sometimes **you know more** about the type than TypeScript does. You can use the `as` keyword to assert a type.

```ts
let input = document.getElementById("username") as HTMLInputElement;
input.value = "Alice";
```

Another syntax (not recommended in `.tsx` files because of JSX conflict):

```ts
let input = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById("username");
```

---

### ‚ùó **3. Non-Null Assertions (`!`)**

When you're sure a value **is not null or undefined**, you can use the `!` operator:

```ts
const form = document.querySelector("form")!; // Asserts it's non-null
form.submit();
```

Use cautiously ‚Äî if you're wrong, it can cause runtime errors.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **When to Use Type Assertions**

* Accessing DOM elements (e.g., HTMLInputElement)
* Working with external APIs or `any` types
* When narrowing complex union types manually

Would you like to go deeper into **type guards**, **generics**, or **advanced narrowing techniques** next?
