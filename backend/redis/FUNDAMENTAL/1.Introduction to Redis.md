### 🧠 **Redis Fundamentals (All Roles)**

Redis is a powerful **in-memory data structure store** often used for **caching**, **real-time analytics**, **session storage**, **message brokering**, and more.

### 🚀 **1. What is Redis?**

* **Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)** is an open-source, in-memory key-value store.
* It supports **varied data types**: strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes.
* Written in **C**, designed for **high performance**.

### ⚡️ **Why Use Redis?**

| Feature                  | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧠 **In-Memory**         | Ultra-fast data access – ideal for caching             |
| 🗂️ **Key-Value Store**  | Simple and scalable data format                        |
| 🔁 **Pub/Sub**           | Real-time messaging between services (e.g., chat apps) |
| 💾 **Persistence**       | Can persist to disk using AOF or RDB                   |
| 🔐 **Atomic Operations** | Thread-safe commands with built-in transaction support |

### ✅ **Common Redis Use Cases**

* **Caching API/database responses** to reduce latency.
* **Session storage** in distributed systems (e.g., Express or Flask apps).
* **Rate limiting** (track requests per IP).
* **Leaderboard/Ranking systems** with sorted sets.
* **Task queues** using lists.

### 🔧 **Installation (CLI)**

```bash
# On Ubuntu
sudo apt install redis-server

# Start Redis
sudo systemctl start redis

# Open Redis CLI
redis-cli
```
