# ⏱️ Asynchronous Programming in Node.js

Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous operations using a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This is crucial for building scalable, performant applications—especially I/O-bound ones.

---

## 📞 Callbacks

* **Basic mechanism** to handle async operations.
* A function is passed as an argument to be called later.

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log(data);
});
```

**Problem**: Callback Hell / Pyramid of Doom (nested callbacks make code hard to read and maintain).

---

## ⛓️ Promises

* An improvement over callbacks.
* Represents a value that may be available now, later, or never.

```js
const readFile = require('fs').promises;

readFile('file.txt', 'utf8')
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

* Promises can be chained using `.then()` and handled with `.catch()`.

---

## 🧠 `async/await`

* Syntactic sugar over Promises.
* Makes async code look synchronous.

```js
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function read() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

read();
```

* Greatly improves readability and maintainability.

---

## 🔁 The Event Loop

* The core of Node’s async behavior.
* Manages execution of multiple tasks using a **single-threaded** model.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Call Stack**: Tracks function calls.
2. **Callback Queue**: Stores callback functions.
3. **Event Loop**: Moves tasks from the queue to the call stack when it's empty.

---

## ⚙️ Event-Driven Architecture

* Node.js uses events to signal that something has happened.
* You can **emit** and **listen** to events.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('message', (msg) => {
  console.log('Received:', msg);
});

emitter.emit('message', 'Hello world!');
```

## ✅ Summary

| Concept       | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Callbacks     | Function called when async task completes |
| Promises      | Object representing future completion     |
| `async/await` | Cleaner syntax for Promises               |
| Event Loop    | Core of async behavior in Node.js         |
| EventEmitter  | Node's pub-sub pattern for events         |
