# Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?
- Node.js is an **open-source** and **cross-platform** JavaScript runtime environment.
- It runs the **V8 JavaScript engine** (the core of Google Chrome) **outside the browser**, making it **very performant**.
- Node.js apps **run in a single process**, without creating a new thread for every request.
- It provides **asynchronous I/O primitives** that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

## Why Node.js?
- Non-blocking I/O makes handling **thousands of concurrent connections** efficient.
- No need for thread concurrency management, reducing the chances of bugs.
- **Frontend developers** can now write **server-side code** in JavaScript too.
- **Use latest ECMAScript features** easily by changing Node.js versions without waiting for browser updates.

## How Node.js handles I/O operations:
- When performing an I/O operation (network, database, filesystem):
  - Node.js **does not block the thread**.
  - It **resumes** operations **once the response is received**.

# An Example Node.js Application

## "Hello World" Web Server Example

### Code (CommonJS - `.js` file):

```javascript
const { createServer } = require('node:http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

> **Note**:  
> - Save the file as `server.js`
> - Run using:  
> ```bash
> node server.js
> ```

### Code (Module - `.mjs` file):

If you use ECMAScript modules (MJS), save as `server.mjs` and run:

```bash
node server.mjs
```

## Explanation

- The Node.js `http` module is used to create the server.
- `createServer()` returns a new HTTP server.
- `server.listen(port, hostname, callback)` starts the server.
- The **callback** in `listen` is called once the server is running.
- On every new request:
  - `req` (request object) holds details of the incoming request.
  - `res` (response object) is used to send a response back.
- The response:
  - Set `statusCode` to `200` (OK).
  - Set the response `Content-Type` to `'text/plain'`.
  - Send `"Hello World"` using `res.end()`.

# Useful Tips
- **Install Node.js** if you haven't already: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Always check if you need to use `.js` (CommonJS) or `.mjs` (ECMAScript Modules).
