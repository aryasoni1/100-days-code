# ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and Beyond in Node.js

---

## Overview
- **Node.js** is built on top of **modern V8 versions**.
- New ECMAScript (ECMA-262 specification) features are brought to Node.js quickly along with **performance** and **stability improvements**.

---

## Feature Groups
ECMAScript 2015+ features in Node.js are split into three groups:

| Group | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Shipping Features** | Stable and turned on by default. No runtime flags needed. |
| **Staged Features** | Nearly complete but not yet stable. Enabled using `--harmony` flag. |
| **In Progress Features** | Experimental, individually enabled via harmony flags (⚠️ use for testing only). |

## How to Check ECMAScript Feature Support
- **node.green**:  
  A website that shows ECMAScript feature support across different Node.js versions (based on kangax's compat-table).

---

## How to List In-Progress Features
You can check available "in-progress" V8 features for your Node.js version:
```bash
node --v8-options | grep "in progress"
```
> ⚠️ These features are **unstable** and might be **incomplete or broken**.

---

## About the `--harmony` Flag
- `--harmony` = `--es_staging`
- It **enables staged (almost stable) features**.
- **Advice:**  
  - Remove `--harmony` in production environments for stability.
  - Future Node.js/V8 upgrades may **break your code** if `--harmony` is used carelessly.

---

## How to Check the V8 Version in Node.js
To find the V8 engine version used by your Node.js installation:
```bash
node -p process.versions.v8
```

---

## Important Notes
- New features are **constantly** added to the V8 engine.
- Features enabled by `--harmony` may behave differently across versions.
- Always prefer using features **once they are stable** and **enabled by default**.
