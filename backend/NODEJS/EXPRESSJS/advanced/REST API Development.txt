# 🏗️ Project Structure in Node.js

A well-structured Node.js project ensures maintainability, scalability, and readability. Common architectures include **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) and **Service-Layered** architectures.

---

## 🏗️ Organize with MVC (Model-View-Controller)

The **MVC** pattern separates the project into three main components: **Model**, **View**, and **Controller**.

### 1. **Model**

The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application.

* Handles interaction with the database.
* Defines the schema and data validation.
* Responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

**Example:**

```js
// models/User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

### 2. **View**

The View is responsible for displaying data to the user.

* In a backend context, it’s usually the **response** sent back to the client, like HTML, JSON, etc.
* For API-based projects, View is usually not applicable as the front-end handles rendering.

**Example:**

```js
// In the controller, sending a JSON response as the View
res.json({ message: 'User created successfully' });
```

### 3. **Controller**

The Controller handles the logic of the application and interacts with the Model.

* Receives user requests.
* Processes the data via Models.
* Sends appropriate responses back to the user.

**Example:**

```js
// controllers/userController.js
const User = require('../models/User');

exports.createUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = new User(req.body);
    await user.save();
    res.status(201).json(user);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating user' });
  }
};
```

### Project Structure Example (MVC)

```
/project-root
  /controllers
    userController.js
  /models
    User.js
  /routes
    userRoutes.js
  /views
    userView.js
  app.js
```

## 🔧 Service-Layered Architecture

The **Service-Layered** architecture focuses on business logic separation from the application layers. Instead of having large controllers, logic is encapsulated in services.

### 1. **Services**

* Handle business logic and interact with the models.
* Allows easier unit testing and reuse of logic across controllers.

**Example:**

```js
// services/userService.js
const User = require('../models/User');

exports.createUser = async (userData) => {
  try {
    const user = new User(userData);
    return await user.save();
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error('Error creating user');
  }
};
```

### 2. **Controller**

* Simply receives requests and delegates to services.
* Focuses only on HTTP logic (e.g., response handling, validation).

**Example:**

```js
// controllers/userController.js
const userService = require('../services/userService');

exports.createUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await userService.createUser(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(user);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error creating user' });
  }
};
```

### Project Structure Example (Service-Layered)

```
/project-root
  /controllers
    userController.js
  /models
    User.js
  /services
    userService.js
  /routes
    userRoutes.js
  app.js
```

## 💡 Key Considerations

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from route handling and data manipulation.
2. **Scalability**: Structure your project to handle more features by splitting large files into smaller, modular components.
3. **Testing**: Make testing easier by organizing logic into services or controllers that can be unit-tested independently.
