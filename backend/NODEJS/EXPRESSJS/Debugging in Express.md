# Debugging in Express

Debugging Express apps can be done using the `debug` module, which is already integrated into the framework.

---

## Enabling Debug Logs

To see all internal logs used by Express, set the `DEBUG` environment variable:

### On Unix-based systems:
```bash
DEBUG=express:* node index.js
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:DEBUG = "express:*"; node index.js
```

---

## Example Output from Express Generator App

```bash
$ DEBUG=express:* node ./bin/www
```

Example output:
```
express:router:route new / +0ms
express:router:layer new / +1ms
express:application compile etag weak +1ms
express:application booting in development mode +1ms
...
```

When making a request:
```
express:router dispatching GET / +4ms
express:view lookup "index.pug" +338ms
express:view render "/projects/example/views/index.pug" +1ms
```

---

## Filtering Logs by Component

- Only router logs:
  ```bash
  DEBUG=express:router node index.js
  ```

- Only application logs:
  ```bash
  DEBUG=express:application node index.js
  ```

---

## Custom App Debug Namespace

Apps generated by the `express` CLI use their own namespace.

For example:
```bash
$ express sample-app
$ DEBUG=sample-app:* node ./bin/www
```

---

## Enable Multiple Namespaces

You can enable multiple debug namespaces by separating them with commas:

```bash
DEBUG=http,mail,express:* node index.js
```

---

## Advanced Options

| Variable             | Purpose                                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEBUG`              | Enable/disable specific debugging namespaces           |
| `DEBUG_COLORS`       | Use colors in output (`true` or `false`)              |
| `DEBUG_DEPTH`        | Object inspection depth for `%o`/%`O`                 |
| `DEBUG_FD`           | File descriptor to write debug output to              |
| `DEBUG_SHOW_HIDDEN`  | Show hidden properties during inspection              |

> These variables configure the output behavior of the `debug` module and influence how `%o` and `%O` formatters inspect objects. Refer to Node.js `util.inspect()` documentation for more details.

---

## Summary

- Use `DEBUG=express:*` to view all internal logs.
- Filter logs by component (`express:router`, `express:application`, etc.).
- Customize logging per application with custom namespaces.
- Use `DEBUG_*` environment variables to fine-tune debugging output.
```
