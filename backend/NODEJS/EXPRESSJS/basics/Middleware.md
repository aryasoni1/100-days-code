Here are the **Express.js Middleware** notes in `.md` format:

---

# 🧩 Express.js Middleware

Middleware are functions that have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and `next()` function. They are used to modify `req`/`res` or end the request-response cycle.

```js
function middleware(req, res, next) {
  // Do something
  next(); // Call the next middleware or route
}
```

---

## ✅ Built-in Middleware

### `express.json()`

Parses incoming JSON requests and puts the parsed data in `req.body`.

```js
app.use(express.json());
```

### `express.urlencoded()`

Parses URL-encoded bodies (form submissions). Use `{ extended: true }` for nested objects.

```js
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

---

## 🛠️ Custom Middleware

You can define your own logic:

```js
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);
```

* Runs on every request unless scoped to specific routes.

## 📦 Third-Party Middleware

### `cors`

Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (for frontend-backend communication across domains).

```bash
npm install cors
```

```js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

### `helmet`

Improves security by setting various HTTP headers.

```bash
npm install helmet
```

```js
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());
```

### `morgan`

HTTP request logger middleware.

```bash
npm install morgan
```

```js
const morgan = require('morgan');
app.use(morgan('dev'));
```

---

## ⛓️ Middleware Execution Order

Middleware is executed in the order it is defined.

```js
app.use(middleware1);
app.use(middleware2);
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello');
});
```
