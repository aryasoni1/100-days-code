Responsive Web Design - The Viewport
What is The Viewport?
	• Viewport: The user's visible area of a web page, varying with the device (smaller on mobile phones than on computer screens).
	• Historical Context: Initially, web pages were designed for static, fixed sizes suitable for computer screens. With the advent of tablets and mobile phones, fixed-size pages became impractical.
Setting The Viewport
	• HTML5 Meta Tag: Controls the viewport dimensions and scaling.
		○ Example: html <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
		○ width=device-width: Sets the page width to match the device's screen width.
		○ initial-scale=1.0: Sets the initial zoom level when the page loads.
Size Content to The Viewport
	• Avoid Horizontal Scrolling: Users prefer vertical scrolling.
	• Rules to Follow:
		1. No Large Fixed-Width Elements: Adjust content to fit within the viewport width.
		2. Avoid Reliance on Specific Widths: Ensure content renders well across various devices.
		3. Use CSS Media Queries: Apply different styles for different screen sizes.

Sure! Here are examples and code snippets for both mobile-first and desktop-first design approaches:
Mobile-First Design Example
In a mobile-first approach, you start with styles for small screens and then use media queries to add styles for larger screens.
/* Base styles for mobile */
body {
    font-size: 16px;
    padding: 10px;
}
nav {
    display: block;
}
/* Styles for tablets and larger screens */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
        font-size: 18px;
        padding: 20px;
    }
nav {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
    }
}
/* Styles for desktops and larger screens */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    body {
        font-size: 20px;
        padding: 30px;
    }
nav {
        justify-content: space-around;
    }
}
Desktop-First Design Example
In a desktop-first approach, you start with styles for large screens and then use media queries to adapt for smaller screens.
/* Base styles for desktop */
body {
    font-size: 20px;
    padding: 30px;
}
nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
}
/* Styles for tablets and smaller screens */
