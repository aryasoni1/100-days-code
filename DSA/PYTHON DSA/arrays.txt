Here's a well-structured **Markdown (.md)** note on **Arrays in Python**, covering fixed vs. dynamic arrays, multidimensional arrays, common operations, and in-place vs. out-of-place transformations:

---

# 🧮 Arrays in Python

## 🔹 Overview

* Python does not have built-in fixed-size arrays like C/C++.
* The built-in `list` type is a dynamic array.
* For performance and fixed types, use the `array` module or NumPy arrays.

---

## 📌 Fixed vs. Dynamic Arrays

### ✅ Dynamic Arrays (Python Lists)

* Automatically resize as elements are added or removed.
* Backed by a resizable array under the hood.

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr.append(4)  # Dynamic resizing
```

### ✅ Fixed Arrays (Using `array` Module or NumPy)

* Require a fixed data type.
* Better performance for numerical computations.

```python
from array import array
fixed_arr = array('i', [1, 2, 3])  # Integer-only array
```

---

## 🔢 Multidimensional Arrays

* Use **nested lists** or **NumPy** for efficient multidimensional arrays.

```python
# 2D array using nested lists
matrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]

# Using NumPy
import numpy as np
matrix_np = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```

---

## 🔁 Common Operations

### 1. **Traversal**

```python
for item in arr:
    print(item)
```

### 2. **Insertion**

```python
arr.insert(1, 99)  # Insert 99 at index 1
```

### 3. **Deletion**

```python
arr.remove(99)     # Remove first occurrence of 99
del arr[0]         # Delete by index
```

---

## ♻️ In-place vs. Out-of-place Transforms

### 🔄 In-place (Modifies original array)

```python
arr.sort()  # Sorts the array in place
```

### 🔁 Out-of-place (Creates a new array)

```python
new_arr = sorted(arr)  # Original array remains unchanged
```

## 📚 Summary Table

| Feature               | Dynamic List  | Fixed Array (`array`) | NumPy Array |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Resizeable            | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| Type-specific         | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes       |
| Multidimensional      | ❌ Nested only | ❌ Not supported       | ✅ Supported |
| Performance (Numeric) | 🚫 Low        | ⚠️ Medium             | ✅ High      |
