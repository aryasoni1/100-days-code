# 📘 Linked List Operations – Data Structures and Algorithms

## 🧰 Basic Operations on Linked Lists

1. **Traversal**
2. **Insertion**
3. **Deletion**
4. **Sorting**

> All examples below use **Singly Linked Lists** for explanation.

---

## 🔄 Traversal

- **Definition**: Visiting each node in the list from `head` to `null`.
- **Use Cases**: Searching, reading/modifying data, deleting or inserting nodes.

### Example in Python:
```python
def traverseAndPrint(head):
    currentNode = head
    while currentNode:
        print(currentNode.data, end=" -> ")
        currentNode = currentNode.next
    print("null")
```

---

## 🔎 Find the Lowest Value

- Traverse the list and compare each node’s data.
- Update `minValue` when a lower value is found.

### Example:
```python
def findLowestValue(head):
    minValue = head.data
    currentNode = head.next
    while currentNode:
        if currentNode.data < minValue:
            minValue = currentNode.data
        currentNode = currentNode.next
    return minValue
```

---

## ❌ Deleting a Specific Node

- Connect the previous node to the next of the node to be deleted.
- Special case: If the node is the head, return `head.next`.

### Example:
```python
def deleteSpecificNode(head, nodeToDelete):
    if head == nodeToDelete:
        return head.next

    currentNode = head
    while currentNode.next and currentNode.next != nodeToDelete:
        currentNode = currentNode.next

    if currentNode.next is None:
        return head

    currentNode.next = currentNode.next.next
    return head
```

---

## ➕ Inserting a Node at a Specific Position

- Create a new node and insert it at the desired position.
- Update the pointers accordingly.
- If inserting at position 1, new node becomes the head.

### Example:
```python
def insertNodeAtPosition(head, newNode, position):
    if position == 1:
        newNode.next = head
        return newNode
    
    currentNode = head
    for _ in range(position - 2):
        if currentNode is None:
            break
        currentNode = currentNode.next

    newNode.next = currentNode.next
    currentNode.next = newNode
    return head
```

## 🔃 Sorting a Linked List

- Sorting techniques like **Selection Sort** can be applied.
- Sorting algorithms like **Counting Sort**, **Radix Sort**, **Quicksort** don't work well with linked lists due to index-based operations.

## 📊 Linked List vs Array

| Feature                         | Linked List                              | Array                                  |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Memory Allocation               | Dynamic                                   | Fixed (or pre-allocated)                |
| Contiguity                      | Non-contiguous                            | Contiguous                              |
| Access Time                     | O(n) (Traversal required)                 | O(1) (Index-based access)               |
| Insertion/Deletion              | Easy (pointer updates)                    | Costly (shifting elements)              |
| Memory Overhead                 | Higher (due to pointers)                  | Lower                                   |
| Language Support                | Less (manual node handling)               | Strong (built-in array methods)         |

## 🕒 Time Complexity of Linked List Operations

| Operation                 | Time Complexity | Notes                                              |
|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Traversal/Search          | O(n)             | Linear scan                                        |
| Insertion at Head         | O(1)             | Constant time if inserting at beginning            |
| Insertion at Tail         | O(n)             | Unless tail pointer is maintained                  |
| Insertion at Position     | O(n)             | Needs traversal to position                        |
| Deletion at Head          | O(1)             | Directly remove head                               |
| Deletion at Position      | O(n)             | Needs traversal to previous node                   |
| Finding Lowest Value      | O(n)             | Full traversal required                            |
| Sorting                   | O(n log n) or O(n²) | Depends on the sorting algorithm                  |

## ❗ Important Notes

- **Binary Search is not possible** on linked lists due to lack of direct access.
- **Sorting algorithms using indices** are not compatible with linked lists.
- Linked Lists are best used for **dynamic memory**, **frequent insert/delete**, and when **random access is not required**.
