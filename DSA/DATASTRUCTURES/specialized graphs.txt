# üìä Specialized Graphs

Graphs are fundamental structures in computer science, and they come in many variations based on their properties and the types of problems they are used to solve. Below are notes on specialized graphs.

## üåê Sparse vs. Dense Graphs

### 1. **Sparse Graph**

* **Definition**: A graph is considered **sparse** if it has relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices.
* **Edge Count**: If a graph has $V$ vertices, it is sparse if the number of edges $E$ is much smaller than $V^2$. In fact, $E$ is generally $O(V)$ or $O(V \log V)$.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Usually represented using **adjacency lists** because they are efficient in terms of space when there are few edges.
  * Example: A tree is a sparse graph because it has $V-1$ edges for $V$ vertices.

#### Example: Sparse Graph

```python
# Sparse graph example with adjacency list representation
graph = {
    0: [1],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [1],
    3: [4],
    4: [3]
}
```

### 2. **Dense Graph**

* **Definition**: A graph is considered **dense** if it has a large number of edges compared to the number of vertices.
* **Edge Count**: If a graph has $V$ vertices, it is dense if the number of edges $E$ is close to $V^2$. In a fully connected graph, there are $O(V^2)$ edges.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Usually represented using **adjacency matrices** because they are efficient for dense graphs where most of the cells in the matrix are non-zero.

#### Example: Dense Graph

```python
# Dense graph example with adjacency matrix representation
graph = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],  # Node 0 connected to Node 1 and Node 2
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],  # Node 1 connected to Node 0, Node 2, and Node 3
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],  # Node 2 connected to Node 0, Node 1, and Node 4
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],  # Node 3 connected to Node 1 and Node 4
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]   # Node 4 connected to Node 2 and Node 3
]
```

### Time Complexity Considerations:

* **Sparse Graph**:

  * Space complexity for adjacency list: $O(V + E)$.
  * Traversal complexity (DFS/BFS): $O(V + E)$.
* **Dense Graph**:

  * Space complexity for adjacency matrix: $O(V^2)$.
  * Traversal complexity (DFS/BFS): $O(V^2)$ if using adjacency matrix.

## üåç Implicit Graphs (Grid as Graph)

### 1. **Implicit Graphs**

* **Definition**: An **implicit graph** is a graph where the vertices and edges are not explicitly stored. Instead, they are implicitly defined by some structure or rule.
* **Example**: A **grid** is often treated as an implicit graph where each cell represents a vertex, and edges exist between adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and sometimes diagonals).

#### Characteristics of Implicit Graphs:

* **Grid** as a 2D implicit graph: In a grid, each position (row, column) can be considered a node, and edges exist between adjacent nodes.
* **No explicit edge list**: The connections are implicit based on the grid's structure rather than explicitly stored.

#### Example: Grid as Implicit Graph

```python
# Grid represented as implicit graph (in 2D matrix form)
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],  # 1 represents an obstacle or blocked cell
    [0, 0, 0]
]

# Neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) from (1, 1) are (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 2).
```

* **Use Case**: Grid-based algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **A* search*\* are commonly used to find paths in such implicit graphs (e.g., finding the shortest path in a maze).

### 2. **Grid Representation**

* **Vertices**: Each grid cell is treated as a vertex.
* **Edges**: Connections (edges) exist between adjacent cells (e.g., north, south, east, west).
* **No need for explicit graph data structure**: The grid itself serves as the implicit graph representation.

#### Example: Pathfinding in Grid (Implicit Graph)

```python
# BFS or DFS in a grid (representing an implicit graph)
def bfs(grid, start, end):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # up, down, left, right
    queue = [start]
    visited = set([start])

    while queue:
        r, c = queue.pop(0)
        
        if (r, c) == end:
            return True
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] != 1 and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    
    return False

# Example call
bfs(grid, (0, 0), (2, 2))  # Check if there is a path from (0, 0) to (2, 2)
```
