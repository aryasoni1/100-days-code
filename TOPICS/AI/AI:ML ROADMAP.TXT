Here’s a **comprehensive roadmap** to transition into **AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning)** from a full-stack development background like yours:

---

## 🧭 AI/ML Roadmap for Full-Stack Developers (2024–2025)

---

### 📍 Phase 1: **Foundations (1–2 months)**

**Goal:** Build a solid math and Python base

* 🔢 **Math Refresher**

  * Linear Algebra → vectors, matrices (Khan Academy / 3Blue1Brown)
  * Calculus → derivatives, gradients (focus on backprop)
  * Probability & Statistics → distributions, Bayes’ Theorem

* 🐍 **Python for ML**

  * Learn NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
  * Do hands-on data manipulation, visualization, feature engineering

📘 *Resources:*

* “Mathematics for Machine Learning” (Coursera)
* “Python for Data Science Handbook” by Jake VanderPlas
* Kaggle micro-courses

---

### 📍 Phase 2: **Machine Learning Core (2–3 months)**

**Goal:** Understand ML theory and build classical ML models

* 📊 **Supervised Learning** → Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
* 📈 **Unsupervised Learning** → K-Means, PCA, Clustering
* 🛠️ Build projects with real datasets (e.g., Titanic, House Prices)

📘 *Courses:*

* Andrew Ng’s ML Course (Coursera)
* Kaggle Competitions (start simple)

---

### 📍 Phase 3: **Deep Learning & Neural Networks (2–3 months)**

**Goal:** Learn deep learning fundamentals and start using PyTorch or TensorFlow

* 🧠 Neural Networks → forward/backpropagation
* 🏗️ Build: Image classifier (MNIST, CIFAR), Sentiment analysis, etc.
* 🧰 Frameworks: PyTorch (preferred), TensorFlow
* 🔎 Intro to CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transfer Learning

📘 *Courses:*

* DeepLearning.AI Specialization by Andrew Ng
* “Make Your Own Neural Network” by Tariq Rashid (book)

---

### 📍 Phase 4: **AI Specialization Track (3–6 months)**

**Choose your track:**
✅ **Computer Vision (CV)**

* Object detection (YOLO, SSD), image segmentation (UNet)
* Libraries: OpenCV, TorchVision
* Projects: Face recognition, pose detection, OCR

✅ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

* Transformers (BERT, GPT), text classification, summarization
* Libraries: HuggingFace Transformers
* Projects: Chatbot, Sentiment Analyzer, QA System

✅ **Generative AI**

* LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering
* Tools: LangChain, OpenAI API, Weights & Biases

---

### 📍 Phase 5: **MLOps & Deployment (2–3 months, parallel)**

**Goal:** Productionize models

* 🐳 Dockerize models
* 🚀 Model deployment: FastAPI, Flask, Streamlit
* 🔁 Model versioning: MLflow, DVC
* 📈 Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
* ⛓️ Pipelines: Airflow, Kubeflow

📘 *Projects:*

* Deploy a full ML pipeline (ETL + model + dashboard)
* Host on AWS/GCP

---

### 📍 Phase 6: **Portfolio & Interviews (Ongoing)**

* 📁 Create GitHub repos with clear READMEs and demo links
* 📜 Write blog posts on Medium or Hashnode
* 🎓 Contribute to open source (HuggingFace, LangChain, PyTorch)
* 💬 Practice DSA + ML Interview Qs (Leetcode + ML Qs from Amazon, Google)

---

### 🚀 BONUS: Capstone Projects

* AI-powered e-commerce recommender system
* Resume parser + ranker using NLP
* Autonomous vehicle simulation (CV)
* ChatGPT-style fine-tuned chatbot for a domain (healthcare/finance)
