Certainly! Here's a **structured roadmap for mastering Operating Systems (OS)**, organized by **core concepts**, **practical backend relevance**, **system design & interview prep**, and **projects/simulations**. This roadmap helps **backend developers, system programmers, and SDE aspirants** build strong OS foundations for interviews and scalable systems development.

---

## ✅ **1. OS Fundamentals (All Roles)**  
**Build foundational knowledge of how computers work under the hood**:  
- **What is an Operating System?**
  - Functions: resource management, abstraction, multitasking
  - Types: Batch, Time-sharing, Real-time, Distributed OS
- **Processes vs Threads**:
  - Process lifecycle, PCB (Process Control Block)
  - Thread vs process, multithreading, thread safety
- **Modes & Interfaces**:
  - User mode vs Kernel mode  
  - System calls, interrupt handling

**Interview Questions**:
- *“What happens when you run a program?”*  
- *“Difference between process and thread?”*

## 💾 **2. Process Management & Scheduling**  
**Understand how OS handles multiple programs**:  
1. **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:
   - FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling
   - Preemptive vs Non-preemptive
2. **Context Switching**:
   - How and why context switches happen  
   - Time-sharing in multitasking OS
3. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:
   - Shared memory, pipes, message queues, semaphores

**Interview Questions**:
- *“How does Round Robin scheduling work?”*  
- *“Explain how context switching works.”*

## 🔐 **3. Memory Management**  
**How OS handles RAM and virtual memory efficiently**:  
1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Contiguous (first-fit, best-fit, worst-fit)
   - Paging and segmentation
2. **Virtual Memory**:
   - Page tables, TLB, page faults  
   - Demand paging and memory-mapped files
3. **Swapping & Thrashing**:
   - Stack vs heap memory  
   - Preventing memory leaks

**Interview Questions**:
- *“What is paging and how does it help memory management?”*  
- *“What causes thrashing?”*

## 💽 **4. File Systems & I/O Management**  
**Understand how OS handles storage and input/output**:  
1. **File System Concepts**:
   - Hierarchical structure, inodes, metadata
   - File allocation methods: contiguous, linked, indexed
2. **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**:
   - FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN
3. **I/O Buffering & Caching**:
   - Device drivers and interrupt-driven I/O  
   - DMA (Direct Memory Access)

**Interview Questions**:
- *“How does the OS find a file?”*  
- *“What is the difference between buffering and caching?”*

---

## 🧠 **5. Concurrency & Synchronization**  
**Handle parallelism, deadlocks, and race conditions**:  
1. **Race Conditions**:
   - Critical section problem  
   - Mutex, Semaphore, Monitor
2. **Deadlock Handling**:
   - Necessary conditions, prevention, avoidance, detection
   - Banker's Algorithm
3. **Concurrency Models**:
   - Fork-join, producer-consumer, readers-writers

**Interview Questions**:
- *“What are the necessary conditions for deadlock?”*  
- *“Explain semaphore with example.”*

## ⚙️ **6. OS in Backend Systems & DevOps**  
**Learn OS features relevant to real-world backend work**:  
1. **Process Control in Unix/Linux**:
   - `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`, `kill()`  
   - Signals and traps
2. **System Monitoring Tools**:
   - `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iotop`, `strace`
3. **File Permissions & Users**:
   - `chmod`, `chown`, `umask`, user groups
4. **Scheduling & Crons**:
   - `cron`, `at`, `systemd` for background jobs

---

## 🧩 **7. OS in System Design & Interviews**  
**Apply OS knowledge to high-level architecture questions**:  
1. **Resource Management in Systems**:
   - Load balancing, request queues, system tuning
2. **Scalability vs Concurrency**:
   - Thread pools, event loops, async IO
3. **OS & Distributed Systems**:
   - Process migration, distributed file systems
   - Consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft) basics

**SDE-Level Interview Questions**:
- *“Design a job scheduler like crontab.”*  
- *“What happens at OS level during a HTTP request?”*

---

## 🛠️ **OS Tools & Ecosystem**
- **Languages**: C, C++, Rust (for OS-level programming)  
- **Simulators**: NachOS, PintOS, xv6  
- **Linux Commands**: ps, top, kill, nice, ulimit  
- **Monitoring**: htop, strace, perf  
- **Shell**: Bash scripting for automation
