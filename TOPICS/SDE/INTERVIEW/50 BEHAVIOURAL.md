# Behavioral Interview Questions for Entry-Level FAANG SDE Roles

Behavioral interviews at top tech companies focus on how candidates have handled past situations using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework. FAANG interviews often probe for qualities embedded in each company’s values: for example, Amazon’s Leadership Principles emphasize “Ownership” (leaders act on behalf of the entire company and “never say it’s not my job”), Google evaluates “Googliness” (traits like bias for action, humility, comfort with ambiguity, and high standards), and Meta’s values highlight moving fast and building great products (“Move Fast” and “Build Awesome Things”). The questions below (organized by skill area) are examples tailored to entry-level SDE candidates. Each is phrased to encourage a STAR-style response (describe the situation/task, the actions you took, and the results you achieved).
