Here‚Äôs a complete list of **Web Server topics to study** for a **Fullstack Developer** and **SDE preparing for FAANG**, with concise explanations where needed. Web servers are essential in handling HTTP requests, serving static and dynamic content, routing, load balancing, and more.

---

## üåê **1. What is a Web Server?**
> A web server is software or hardware that handles HTTP requests from clients (like browsers) and delivers web content such as HTML pages, images, or data APIs.

Examples: **Nginx**, **Apache**, **Node.js with Express**, **Caddy**, **Tomcat** (Java).

---

## üß± **2. Popular Web Servers**
- **Nginx** ‚Äì High performance, efficient reverse proxy and load balancer.
- **Apache HTTP Server** ‚Äì Flexible and widely used with rich module support.
- **Node.js (with Express/Koa)** ‚Äì Custom web server inside applications.
- **Caddy** ‚Äì Auto HTTPS, developer-friendly.
- **Tomcat** ‚Äì Servlet container for Java apps (Spring Boot).
- **Gunicorn** ‚Äì Python WSGI HTTP server.

---

## üì¶ **3. Serving Static Files**
> Hosting HTML, CSS, JS, images directly from the server without backend processing.

- Configure static file directories.
- Important for frontend apps like React/Vue builds.

---

## üîÅ **4. Reverse Proxy**
> A web server that forwards requests to one or more backend servers.

Used to:
- Hide backend logic
- Enable HTTPS/SSL termination
- Load balance across multiple instances

---

## üîÄ **5. Load Balancing**
> Distributes incoming traffic among multiple backend servers for high availability and performance.

- Algorithms: Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hash.
- Done via Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-based services (AWS ELB, GCP Load Balancer).

---

## üîê **6. HTTPS / SSL / TLS**
> Secure communication between client and server using encryption.

- Learn about SSL certificates (Let‚Äôs Encrypt, self-signed).
- TLS handshake and certificate verification.
- SSL termination at the web server level.

---

## üìÅ **7. Web Server Configuration**
- Nginx (`nginx.conf`), Apache (`httpd.conf`), etc.
- `server` and `location` blocks (Nginx)
- Virtual hosts, document root, ports

---

## üöÄ **10. Caching**
> Reduce load by storing and reusing responses.

---

## üß© **14. Virtual Hosting (Multi-site Hosting)**
> Serve multiple domains from one server using server blocks or virtual hosts.

---

## üß∞ **15. Web Server in Docker**
- Use Nginx or Apache containers

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **17. MIME Types**
> Tell the browser how to handle different file types.
- `Content-Type: text/html`, `application/json`, `image/png`, etc.

---

## üîÑ **18. HTTP Request Lifecycle**
> Understanding what happens from the browser to server and back:
1. DNS Resolution
2. TCP Connection + TLS Handshake (if HTTPS)
3. HTTP request sent
4. Response received and rendered

---

## üß† **19. HTTP Methods and Status Codes**
- Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
- Status: 200 OK, 301 Moved, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error

---

## üßµ **20. Connection Handling**
- Keep-alive vs. close
- Concurrent connections
- Max worker processes / threads

---

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive list of **topics to study in Web Server (Nginx)** for a **Fullstack Developer** and **SDE preparing for FAANG**, with concise definitions where necessary. Nginx is a high-performance, open-source web server often used as a **reverse proxy**, **load balancer**, and **HTTP cache**.

---

## üåê **1. What is Nginx?**
> Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a web server designed for **high concurrency**, **low memory usage**, and **reverse proxying**.

Used for:
- Serving static files
- Proxying requests to backend apps
- Load balancing
- SSL termination
- Rate limiting & caching

---

## üìÅ **2. Basic Nginx Structure**
- `nginx.conf` ‚Äì The main configuration file.
- **Directives** ‚Äì Instructions in Nginx config files.
- **Context blocks**:
  - `http {}` ‚Äì HTTP server settings
  - `server {}` ‚Äì Defines a virtual server
  - `location {}` ‚Äì Handles request URIs

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **3. Serving Static Content**
- Host static HTML, CSS, JS files directly from Nginx.
```nginx
location /static/ {
    root /var/www/html;
}
```

---

## üîÅ **4. Reverse Proxy**
> Forwards client requests to backend servers (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
}
```
Used in MERN and Spring Boot projects for routing.

---

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server app1.example.com;
    server app2.example.com;
}

location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
}
```

---

## üîí **6. SSL/TLS with HTTPS**
- Use Nginx as an **SSL terminator** with **Let's Encrypt** or self-signed certificates.
```nginx
listen 443 ssl;
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cert.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/key.pem;
```

---

## üåç **7. Virtual Hosts (Server Blocks)**
> Serve multiple websites from the same server.

server {
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/example;
}
```

---

## üöß **8. Error Handling**

```nginx
proxy_cache_path /tmp/cache keys_zone=my_cache:10m;
```

---

## üöÄ **12. Gzip Compression**

```

---

## üß± **15. Nginx in Docker**
- Run Nginx in containers.

- Combine with Docker Compose for fullstack apps.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **16. Nginx Modules (Advanced)**
