Here's a comprehensive list of **Software Design and Architecture topics** to study for a **Fullstack Developer** and **SDE preparing for FAANG**, with concise definitions and concepts explained.

These topics help build scalable, maintainable, and testable systems — critical in FAANG-level engineering roles.

---

## 🧱 1. **Software Architecture Basics**
> The high-level structure of a software system, defining components and their interactions.

- Monolithic vs. Microservices
- Client-Server model
- Layered architecture (Presentation, Business, Data)
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Design Principles (SOLID)**
> Core principles to write clean, extensible object-oriented code:
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle  
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle  
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle  
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle  
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

---

## 📦 3. **Design Patterns**
> Reusable solutions to common design problems:
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Composite
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command, State

---

## 🗺️ 4. **System Design Fundamentals**
- High-Level Design (HLD) vs. Low-Level Design (LLD)
- API Design (REST, GraphQL)
- Database Design (ER diagrams, normalization, denormalization)
- Data Modeling: Relational vs. NoSQL
- Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

---

## 🔁 5. **Scalability and Performance**
> Designing systems to handle increased load.
- Horizontal vs. Vertical scaling
- Load Balancers
- Caching strategies (Redis, CDN)
- Sharding and Partitioning

---

## 🗃️ 6. **Data Flow and State Management**
- Stateless vs. Stateful systems
- Application state management (e.g., Redux, Context API)
- Backend session vs. token-based auth (JWT, OAuth2)

---

## 🔌 7. **API Design Best Practices**
- RESTful APIs, HATEOAS, OpenAPI (Swagger)
- Versioning strategies
- Rate limiting
- Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2, API keys)

---

## 🧪 8. **Testability and Maintainability**
- Writing testable code (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Separation of concerns (SoC)

---

## 🧰 9. **Microservices Architecture**
> Breaking applications into small, independent services:
- Communication via REST, gRPC, or messaging queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Service Discovery
- Circuit Breaker Pattern
- API Gateway

---

## 🛡️ 10. **Security in Architecture**
- Secure authentication (JWT, OAuth2, SAML)
- HTTPS, encryption, password hashing
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

---

## 🧱 11. **Modular and Layered Architecture**
- Presentation Layer (UI)
- Business Logic Layer (Service Layer)
- Data Access Layer (Repository)
- Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture

---

## 🌐 12. **Event-Driven Architecture**
> Systems that communicate using events:
- Publish-Subscribe Pattern
- Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- CQRS and Event Sourcing

---

## ⚖️ 13. **Trade-offs and CAP Theorem**
> You can only have 2 out of 3: **Consistency**, **Availability**, **Partition Tolerance**

- Understand consistency models (strong vs eventual)
- BASE vs. ACID

---

## 🕸️ 14. **Distributed Systems Concepts**
- Consensus protocols (Paxos, Raft)
- Clock synchronization
- Leader election
- Data replication and consistency

---

## 🚀 15. **Deployment Architecture**
- Monolith → Containerized → Microservices
- CI/CD pipelines
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Service Mesh (e.g., Istio)

---

## 🧩 16. **Component Diagrams & UML**
- UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams
- System context and component diagrams for architectural clarity

---

## 🧠 17. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
> Focuses on modeling software around the business domain:
- Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates
- Bounded Contexts
- Ubiquitous Language

---

## 🔄 18. **Asynchronous Architecture**
> Improving responsiveness and decoupling components:
- Message queues
- Job queues (e.g., Celery, Bull, Sidekiq)
- Async APIs and event handlers

---

## ⚓ 19. **Dependency Management**
- Inversion of control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI)
- Using tools like Spring's IoC container, NestJS DI

---

## 📊 20. **Monitoring and Observability**
- Logging, metrics, tracing
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
