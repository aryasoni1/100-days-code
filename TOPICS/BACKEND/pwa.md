## 🚀 Progressive Web App (PWA) Study Guide for Full-Stack & FAANG SDEs

---

### 🧩 **1. What is a PWA?**
- A **Progressive Web App** is a web application that uses modern web capabilities to **deliver an app-like experience** to users. It works **offline**, is **installable**, **responsive**, and can **send push notifications**.

---

### 📱 **2. Core PWA Principles**
- **Reliable**: Works offline or with poor network.
- **Fast**: Loads quickly and responds fast to user interaction.
- **Engaging**: Feels like a native app with installability and push notifications.

---

### 📄 **3. Web App Manifest**
- A JSON file that provides metadata about the web app (like name, icon, theme color, display type).
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - `name`, `short_name`, `start_url`
  - `display`: `standalone`, `fullscreen`, etc.
  - `icons`: Different sizes for installability
  - `theme_color`, `background_color`

---

### 🔧 **4. Service Workers**
- A JavaScript script that runs in the background and intercepts network requests, enabling offline functionality.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - Registering a service worker
  - Caching strategies (Cache First, Network First, Stale While Revalidate)
  - Lifecycle: `install`, `activate`, `fetch`
  - Updating service workers
  - Push notifications with service workers

---

### 💾 **5. Caching and Offline Strategies**
- Using Cache API and IndexedDB to persist data for offline use.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - `Workbox` for caching strategies
  - Runtime vs Pre-caching
  - Handling cache invalidation

---

### 📥 **6. Installability**
- Make your app installable on desktop and mobile.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - `beforeinstallprompt` event
  - Adding install button manually
  - `display: standalone` or `fullscreen` in manifest

---

### 🔔 **7. Push Notifications & Background Sync**
- Engage users with native-like notifications even when the app is closed.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - Push API and Notification API
  - VAPID keys and subscription
  - Background sync with Service Workers

---

### ⚡ **8. Performance Optimization**
- PWAs must be fast and responsive.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - Lazy loading
  - Code splitting (especially in React/Vue/Angular)
  - Lighthouse performance audits

---

### 🔒 **9. HTTPS & Security**
- PWAs **must be served over HTTPS** for service workers and push notifications.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, etc.)
  - CSP headers
  - Avoiding mixed content

---

### 📱 **10. Responsive Design**
- Ensure the PWA works across devices and screen sizes.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - Media queries, flexbox, grid
  - Mobile-first development
  - Viewport meta tag

---

### 🔍 **11. Lighthouse and Audits**
- Lighthouse is a tool to audit and measure PWA compliance and performance.
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - How to run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
  - Fixing common audit failures (e.g., missing manifest, poor offline experience)

---

### 🧪 **12. Testing PWAs**
- **Topics to Learn**:
  - Simulating offline behavior in DevTools
  - Testing `beforeinstallprompt` flow
  - Testing push notification opt-in
  - Unit testing service workers (e.g., with Workbox)

---

### 🛠 **13. Framework-Specific PWA Setup**
- **React**: `create-react-app` with service worker setup, or `vite-plugin-pwa`
- **Next.js**: Next PWA plugin
- **Vue**: Vue CLI PWA plugin
- **Angular**: Angular Service Worker module

---

### 🌍 **14. PWA Deployment**
- Deploy with HTTPS (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase).
- Support for PWA in Android and limited support on iOS (check latest Safari behavior).

---

### 🧠 **15. Real-World PWA Examples**
- Twitter Lite  
- Starbucks  
- Pinterest  
- Uber  
- Google Maps Go
