Absolutely! Here's a **comprehensive list of API-related topics** tailored for **Full-Stack Developers** and **SDE roles at FAANG** companies. Each topic includes brief definitions or context to help you understand what to focus on. These topics cover **core concepts**, **design best practices**, **security**, **performance**, **testing**, and **interview-level insights**.

## ‚úÖ **1. API Fundamentals**
- **What is an API?**  
  A set of rules that allows software components to communicate ‚Äî often HTTP-based in web dev.
  
- **Types of APIs**:  
  - REST (most common)  
  - GraphQL (flexible querying)  
  - gRPC (binary protocol, fast for microservices)  
  - WebSockets (real-time, full-duplex communication)

- **HTTP Basics**:  
  - Methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`  
  - Status Codes: `200`, `201`, `204`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`, etc.  
  - Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, CORS headers

---

## üì¶ **2. REST API Design**
- **REST Principles**:  
  Stateless, resource-based, client-server, cacheable

- **CRUD Operations**:  
  Create (POST), Read (GET), Update (PUT/PATCH), Delete (DELETE)

- **Routing & Naming Conventions**:  
  Use nouns for endpoints (`/users`, `/products`), use nested routes (`/users/:id/orders`)

- **Versioning**:  
  `/api/v1/` ‚Äî ensures backward compatibility

- **Pagination**:  
  Offset-based or cursor-based pagination for large datasets

---

## üîê **3. API Security**
- **Authentication**:  
  - Token-based (JWT)  
  - OAuth 2.0 (third-party identity providers)  
  - API keys (less secure, basic protection)

- **Authorization**:  
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)  
  - Scope-based permissions

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:  
  Allowing frontend apps on different origins to call the API

- **Rate Limiting**:  
  Prevent abuse by limiting requests (e.g., `express-rate-limit`)

- **Input Validation**:  
  Use libraries like `Joi`, `express-validator`, or `Zod` to prevent injection attacks

- **HTTPS Everywhere**:  
  Always use TLS to encrypt data

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **4. API Architecture & Best Practices**
- **MVC Pattern**:  
  Separate routes, controllers, services, and models for clean code

- **Middleware**:  
  Functions that process requests before they hit the controller (e.g., logging, auth checks)

- **Service Layer**:  
  Business logic separated from controller logic

- **Error Handling**:  
  Consistent error response formats and proper status codes

- **Logging**:  
  Track usage and errors using tools like Winston, Morgan, or centralized systems

---

## üöÄ **5. API Performance & Scaling**
- **Caching**:  
  - Response-level caching (e.g., Redis, CDN)  
  - HTTP Cache headers (`ETag`, `Cache-Control`)

- **Load Balancing**:  
  Distribute traffic using tools like Nginx or cloud services

- **Throttling & Debouncing**:  
  Prevent repeated API calls from the client-side

- **Async Processing**:  
  Queue time-consuming tasks (email, image processing) using workers (BullMQ, RabbitMQ)

---

## üîÑ **6. API Testing**
- **Unit Testing**:  
  Test isolated logic in controllers and services

- **Integration Testing**:  
  Test full request-response cycle using tools like Supertest or Postman

- **Contract Testing**:  
  Ensure the frontend and backend are aligned in data structure (e.g., using Pact)

- **Mocking APIs**:  
  Tools like `msw`, `nock`, or Postman mocks for frontend testing

---

## üåê **7. API Documentation**
- **OpenAPI (Swagger)**:  
  Automatically generate interactive API docs from code

- **Postman Collections**:  
  Shareable request collections for testing and collaboration

---

## üß† **8. API Interview Preparation (FAANG SDE Level)**
- **Design a Scalable REST API**:  
  Be ready to design endpoints, handle edge cases, and discuss rate limiting, auth, and caching

- **Explain REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC**

- **Concurrency in APIs**:  
  How to handle multiple parallel requests, race conditions, and idempotency

- **Idempotency**:  
  Making multiple identical requests produce the same effect (`PUT`, `DELETE`)

- **Error Patterns**:  
  Use proper status codes and include helpful messages

- **API Gateway Concepts**:  
  Manage microservices using tools like Kong, API Gateway, or NGINX

---

## üî® **Tools You Should Know**
- **Postman / Insomnia** ‚Äî for manual API testing  
- **Swagger / Redoc** ‚Äî for auto-documentation  
- **Redis** ‚Äî for response caching or rate limiting  
- **Jest / Supertest / Mocha** ‚Äî for backend testing  
- **Axios / Fetch** ‚Äî for API calls in frontend  
- **Express.js / FastAPI / Spring Boot** ‚Äî API development frameworks  
- **Docker** ‚Äî for containerized APIs
