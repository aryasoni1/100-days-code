Here you go ‚Äî a **structured roadmap for mastering MySQL**, crafted in the same style as your previous Express.js, Node.js, and Redis roadmaps. It‚Äôs divided into **frontend**, **backend**, **full-stack**, and **SDE interview preparation** tracks, with a primary focus on backend data handling and systems design.

## ‚úÖ **1. MySQL Fundamentals (All Roles)**  
**Essential concepts every developer should know, regardless of role**:
- **Introduction to MySQL**:
  - What is MySQL? RDBMS overview
  - Installing MySQL locally or using Docker
  - MySQL Workbench / CLI / phpMyAdmin
- **Basic SQL Commands**:
  - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
  - Filtering with `WHERE`, ordering with `ORDER BY`, limiting with `LIMIT`
- **Database Design Basics**:
  - Tables, rows, and columns
  - Data types (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `DATE`, `BOOLEAN`)
  - Primary keys, foreign keys, constraints

## üéØ **2. MySQL for Frontend Developers**  
**Understand enough to work with APIs that connect to MySQL**:
1. **How Frontend Talks to MySQL**:
   - REST/GraphQL APIs as the bridge between frontend and MySQL
   - Consuming paginated and filtered data
2. **Mock APIs and Test Data**:
   - Use tools like JSON Server or Postman with MySQL-backed APIs
3. **Frontend Queries Support**:
   - Sorting, searching, filtering using query params ‚Üí SQL queries
4. **Interview Questions**:
   - *‚ÄúHow do frontend filters map to SQL queries?‚Äù*
   - *‚ÄúWhy is pagination important for frontend apps?‚Äù*

## üíª **3. MySQL for Backend Developers**  
**Backend engineers work directly with MySQL for queries, relationships, and optimizations**:
1. **Relational Database Design**:
   - One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships
   - Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
   - ER diagrams
2. **Query Mastery**:
   - Joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`
   - Aggregations: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`
   - Subqueries, `IN`, `EXISTS`, `CASE`, `COALESCE`
3. **Indexing & Performance**:
   - Indexes for speed (`CREATE INDEX`)
   - Query optimization with `EXPLAIN`
4. **Transactions & ACID**:
   - `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
   - Isolation levels, deadlocks
5. **Security & Best Practices**:
   - Avoid SQL injection (`?` placeholders in queries)
   - User roles and permissions (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`)
6. **Interview Topics**:
   - *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?‚Äù*
   - *‚ÄúHow would you optimize a slow query in MySQL?‚Äù*

## üåê **4. MySQL for Full-Stack Developers**  
**Master backend integration and frontend consumption of MySQL data**:
1. **Node.js + MySQL Integration**:
   - Use `mysql2`, `sequelize`, or `knex.js`
   - Connection pooling and environment config
2. **Full-Stack Architecture**:
   - MVC: MySQL ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Controller ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend
   - Handle async DB calls with `await`
3. **Building Features**:
   - Auth system (store users/passwords in MySQL)
   - Profile updates, paginated feeds
   - Advanced filters/search for dashboards
4. **Migrations & Seeds**:
   - Use ORM tools to manage schema (`sequelize-cli`, `knex migrate`)
   - Add seed data for development/testing
5. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Use hosted MySQL services (PlanetScale, AWS RDS, Supabase)
   - Handle connection strings and production credentials
6. **Interview Questions**:
   - *‚ÄúDesign a blogging app with Node and MySQL.‚Äù*
   - *‚ÄúHow do you implement pagination in SQL and expose it to frontend?‚Äù*

## üß† **5. MySQL for SDE Interviews**  
**System design, scalability, transactions, and production data modeling**:
1. **Schema Design in Real-World Systems**:
   - E-commerce: Products, Users, Orders, Reviews schema
   - Messaging: Users, Threads, Messages schema
2. **Normalization vs Denormalization**:
   - Tradeoffs for performance vs simplicity
   - When to use each in high-scale systems
3. **Concurrency and Transactions**:
   - Isolation levels: Read uncommitted, committed, repeatable read, serializable
   - Avoiding dirty reads and phantom reads
4. **High Availability & Replication**:
   - Master-slave replication
   - Read replicas for scaling
5. **Sharding & Partitioning**:
   - Horizontal scaling with sharding keys
   - Vertical partitioning of tables
6. **Interview Questions**:
   - *‚ÄúDesign the schema for a ride-hailing app.‚Äù*
   - *‚ÄúHow would you prevent race conditions in concurrent DB writes?‚Äù*
