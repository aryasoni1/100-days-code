Here’s a comprehensive list of **testing topics** you should study as a **Fullstack Developer** and **SDE preparing for FAANG**. Testing is critical for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications — all of which are crucial in FAANG-level engineering.

---

## 🧪 1. **What is Software Testing?**
> Testing is the process of verifying that your code behaves correctly and reliably under all expected (and unexpected) conditions.

---

## 🔍 2. **Types of Testing (Fundamentals)**

### ✅ **Unit Testing**
- Tests individual functions or components in isolation.
- Fast and often run with every code change.
- **Example:** Testing a `sum(a, b)` function.

### 🧩 **Integration Testing**
- Tests how multiple units/modules work together.
- Ensures components (e.g., frontend ↔ backend or DB ↔ API) interact correctly.

### 🧪 **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
- Simulates a real user interacting with the full app.
- Click buttons, fill forms, navigate pages.
- Used to catch bugs in user flows.

### 🏗️ **System Testing**
- Validates the entire application as a whole.
- Checks compliance with requirements.

### 🔄 **Regression Testing**
- Ensures new changes don’t break existing functionality.

---

## ⚙️ 3. **Testing in JavaScript/Node.js (Fullstack JS)**

### 🔧 **Testing Libraries and Frameworks**
- **Jest** – Most popular for unit + integration testing in JS.
- **Mocha + Chai** – Flexible testing framework and assertion library.
- **Supertest** – For testing Node.js/Express APIs.
- **Vitest** – Fast test runner similar to Jest, compatible with Vite.

### 🎭 **E2E Testing Tools**
- **Cypress** – Powerful E2E testing with UI interface.
- **Playwright** – Browser automation with test writing features.
- **Puppeteer** – Headless Chrome testing.

---

## 🧰 4. **Testing in Frontend (React, Angular, etc.)**

- **React Testing Library (RTL)** – Focuses on testing from the user’s perspective.
- **Jest** – Often used with RTL.
- **Vitest** – Gaining popularity for Vite-based projects.

Test for:
- Button clicks
- API call mocking
- Form submissions
- Component rendering

---

## 🧪 5. **Testing in Backend (Node.js, Spring Boot, etc.)**

### 🛠️ **Node.js/Express**
- **Jest** or **Mocha** for unit testing.
- **Supertest** for API endpoint testing.

### ☕ **Spring Boot**
- **JUnit 5** – Standard testing library.
- **Mockito** – For mocking objects and dependencies.
- **Spring Boot Test** – Integration with Spring context.
- **Testcontainers** – Run actual containers (DBs, etc.) during tests.

---

## 📦 6. **Mocking and Stubbing**
- Replace real dependencies (APIs, DBs) with fake ones for testing.
- Tools:
  - **Jest mocks**
  - **Sinon.js**
  - **Mockito (Java)**

---

## 📈 7. **Code Coverage**
- Measure how much of your code is being tested.
- Tools:
  - `jest --coverage`
  - **Istanbul** (built into Jest)
  - **JaCoCo** (for Java)

Aim for **high coverage**, but remember: **100% doesn’t guarantee bug-free**.

---

## 🔄 8. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
> Write tests **before** writing code.  
Encourages modular and maintainable code. Red-green-refactor cycle.

---

## 🧪 9. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**
> Define behavior of features in human-readable language (Given-When-Then).
- Tools: **Cucumber**, **Jasmine**, **Behave**.

---

## 🧰 10. **CI/CD Integration**
- Run tests automatically on every push or PR.
- Integrate with:
  - **GitHub Actions**
  - **Jenkins**
  - **GitLab CI**
  - **CircleCI**

Use `npm test`, `mvn test`, or equivalent in your workflow.

---

## 🌐 11. **API Testing**
- **Postman** – Manual + automated API testing.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** – Define and test API contracts.
- **Supertest**, **RestAssured** (Java).

---

## 🧩 12. **Database Testing**
- Use test databases (SQLite, H2).
- Seed data before tests.
- Tools: **Knex**, **Prisma**, **Flyway**, **Liquibase**.

---

## 🧵 13. **Performance and Load Testing**
- Measure app performance under heavy load.
- Tools:
  - **JMeter**
  - **k6**
  - **Artillery**
  - **Gatling**

---

## 🧼 14. **Linting and Static Analysis (Related to Testing)**
- Catch issues *before* runtime.
- Tools:
  - **ESLint**, **Prettier**
  - **SonarQube**, **PMD**

---

## ✅ Bonus: Best Practices
- Keep tests **fast** and **isolated**.
- Use **fixtures** or **factories** for test data.
- Avoid flaky or non-deterministic tests.
- Write tests that reflect **real user behavior**.
