Here is a **complete list of Internet-related topics** you need to study to become a **top-tier Fullstack Developer** and crack **SDE roles at FAANG**. These topics will help you understand how the web works from end to end, how data moves across the internet, and how to build and scale modern applications.

---

## 🌐 1. **Internet Basics**
- **What is the Internet?**  
  A global network of interconnected devices that communicate using the TCP/IP protocol.

- **How the Web Works**  
  Client (browser) makes a request → Server processes → Response sent back.

- **Client-Server Model**  
  A model where the client requests resources and the server responds.

---

## 📡 2. **IP, DNS, and Hosting**
- **IP Address (IPv4, IPv6)**  
  Unique identifiers for devices on a network (like addresses for homes).

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**  
  Converts domain names (like `google.com`) to IP addresses.

- **DNS Lookup Process**  
  Resolver → Root server → TLD server → Authoritative name server.

- **Web Hosting & CDNs**  
  Where your website files live and how they are delivered quickly.

---

## 🌐 3. **HTTP & HTTPS**
- **HTTP Methods**  
  `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` — used for REST APIs.

- **Status Codes**  
  - `200 OK`: success  
  - `404 Not Found`: resource missing  
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: something broke on server  
  - `301/302 Redirects`: moved pages  

- **Headers**  
  Carry metadata like content type, auth tokens, cache control.

- **Cookies & Sessions**  
  Track users across sessions and requests.

- **HTTPS (SSL/TLS)**  
  Secure version of HTTP — encrypts data in transit.

---

## 🧠 4. **Web Security Essentials**
- **CORS**  
  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing – controls API access across domains.

- **CSRF & XSS**  
  Prevent cross-site request forgery and cross-site scripting.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**  
  A way to whitelist safe sources for loading scripts, styles, etc.

- **Authentication vs Authorization**  
  AuthN = who are you, AuthZ = what are you allowed to do.

---

## ⚙️ 5. **APIs & Web Communication**
- **REST APIs**  
  Use HTTP methods to communicate with servers in a stateless way.

- **GraphQL**  
  Alternative to REST where clients can query exactly the data they need.

- **WebSockets**  
  For real-time, bi-directional communication (e.g. chat apps).

- **Polling vs Long Polling vs WebSockets**  
  Techniques for getting updates from the server.

---

## 📬 6. **Networking Protocols**
- **TCP/IP**  
  Reliable transport layer protocol; ensures packet delivery.

- **UDP**  
  Fast but unreliable (used in video/gaming).

- **TLS/SSL**  
  Adds encryption on top of TCP for HTTPS.

- **FTP/SFTP**  
  Used for file transfers over networks.

---

## ⚡ 7. **CDNs, Load Balancing & Caching**
- **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**  
  Deliver static files from servers closest to the user.

- **Load Balancers**  
  Distribute traffic across multiple servers.

- **Caching (Browser, CDN, Server)**  
  Store copies of content to speed up response times.

- **ETags, Cache-Control, 304 Not Modified**  
  HTTP mechanisms for efficient caching.

---

## 🔐 8. **OAuth, JWT, and Authentication Flows**
- **OAuth 2.0**  
  Secure delegated access — used by Google/Facebook login.

- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**  
  Token-based authentication, often used in modern APIs.

- **Session-Based Auth**  
  Store session ID in cookies and track state on the server.

---

## 📱 9. **DNS, CDN, and Deployment Workflow**
- **From Code to URL**  
  Code → Build → Deploy → Domain → DNS → CDN → Browser

- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Deployment)**  
  Automatically test and deploy code using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Vercel, Netlify.

---

## 🔍 10. **Browser Internals**
- **Critical Rendering Path**  
  HTML → DOM → CSSOM → Render Tree → Paint → Composite

- **Event Loop & Async Model**  
  JS is single-threaded, uses event loop, call stack, task/microtask queues.

- **Service Workers**  
  Background scripts used for caching, offline access, push notifications.

---

## 🧪 11. **Tools and Monitoring**
- **Ping, Traceroute, nslookup, dig**  
  Diagnose network issues and trace routing paths.

- **Chrome DevTools**  
  Inspect HTTP requests, network activity, caching, rendering.

- **API Testing Tools**  
  Postman, Insomnia — test and document REST APIs.

---

## 🏗️ 12. **Infrastructure and Cloud (Optional, Advanced)**
- **Docker + Docker Networking**  
  Run isolated containers with apps and their dependencies.

- **Kubernetes Basics**  
  Container orchestration for scaling apps.

- **Cloud Providers**  
  AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront), GCP, Azure — deploy fullstack apps at scale.
