Here’s a **comprehensive list of topics to study in npm (Node Package Manager)** for a **Fullstack Developer** and **SDE aiming for FAANG**, along with brief explanations. Understanding npm is essential for managing dependencies and building scalable JavaScript applications.

---

## 📦 1. **What is npm?**
- npm is the **default package manager for Node.js**.
- It allows developers to **install, update, and manage** JavaScript libraries and tools in a project.

---

## 🧱 2. **Core npm Concepts**
- **Packages** – Reusable modules or libraries (e.g., `express`, `react`, `lodash`).
- **Modules** – Code units that follow CommonJS or ES Module systems.
- **Registry** – The public repository (https://www.npmjs.com/) where packages are published.

---

## 📁 3. **package.json**
- The **heart of any Node.js project**.
- Contains project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

---

## 📦 4. **Installing Packages**
- `npm install <package>` – Installs a package.
- `npm install <package>@version` – Install specific version.
- `npm i` – Shortcut for `install`.

**Types:**
- **Dependencies** (`--save`) – Required for app to run.
- **Dev Dependencies** (`--save-dev`) – Used during development (e.g., `nodemon`, `eslint`).
- **Global Packages** (`-g`) – Installed system-wide.

---

## 🗑️ 5. **Uninstalling & Updating**
- `npm uninstall <package>` – Remove a package.
- `npm update` – Update all packages.
- `npm outdated` – Show outdated packages.

---

## 🏷️ 6. **Semantic Versioning**
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)
  - `^1.2.3` – Accept minor/patch updates.
  - `~1.2.3` – Accept only patch updates.
  - `1.2.3` – Exact version.

---

## 📜 7. **npm Scripts**
- Custom commands defined in `package.json`.

Examples:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
  "test": "jest"
}
```
Run with: `npm run dev`, `npm test`

---

## 🧰 8. **Common npm Commands**
- `npm init` – Create a new `package.json`.
- `npm run <script>` – Run a script.
- `npm list` – List installed packages.
- `npm config` – View/edit npm settings.
- `npm ci` – Clean install from `package-lock.json` (for CI/CD pipelines).

---

## 🛡️ 9. **Security & Auditing**
- `npm audit` – Scan for vulnerabilities.
- `npm audit fix` – Automatically fix known issues.

---

## 🧵 10. **Lock Files**
- **`package-lock.json`** – Locks dependency tree to exact versions for reproducibility.
- Always commit this file for consistent builds.

---

## 📤 11. **Publishing Your Own Packages**
- `npm login` – Authenticate with npm registry.
- `npm publish` – Publish your package.
- Follow proper naming, versioning, and documentation.

---

## 🚀 12. **Monorepos and Workspaces (Advanced)**
- Use **npm workspaces** to manage multiple packages/projects in a monorepo.

```json
"workspaces": ["frontend", "backend"]
```

---

## 🧪 13. **Testing with npm**
- Integrate test runners like:
  - `jest`, `mocha`, `chai` for unit testing.
  - Run with `npm test` or define custom `test` script.

---

## 🔁 14. **Alternative Package Managers**
- Understand differences with:
  - **Yarn** – Faster installs, better caching.
  - **pnpm** – Uses symlinks and less disk space.

---

## ✅ Bonus Tips
- Use `.npmrc` for config (e.g., registry, auth tokens).
- Keep dependencies clean — remove unused packages.
- Automate installs in CI/CD with `npm ci` over `npm install`.
