Absolutely! Here's a **comprehensive list of topics to study in Log Management** tailored for **Full-Stack Developers** and **SDEs preparing for FAANG-level roles**. Mastery of logs is essential for debugging, monitoring, observability, and designing resilient, scalable distributed systems.

---

## 🔍 **1. Introduction to Log Management**
- **What are Logs?**  
  Structured or unstructured data capturing events or states in an application, system, or infrastructure.
- **Purpose**:  
  - Troubleshooting & debugging  
  - Auditing  
  - Monitoring  
  - Security & compliance

---

## 📄 **2. Types of Logs**
- **Application Logs**: Custom logs from your app (e.g., login success, error stack traces)  
- **Server Logs**: Web server logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx)  
- **Access Logs**: Track HTTP requests (IP, user-agent, response codes)  
- **Error Logs**: Capture system or app exceptions  
- **System Logs**: OS-level logs (`syslog`, kernel logs)  
- **Audit Logs**: Track changes to resources (security-relevant)

---

## 🏗️ **3. Log Structure and Formats**
- **Structured Logs**: JSON format, key-value pairs — easier to query and process  
- **Unstructured Logs**: Plain text — harder to parse  
- **Log Levels** (Severity):  
  - `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`  
- **Timestamping**: Consistent, ISO 8601 format preferred  
- **Correlation ID**: Unique ID across services for tracing requests

---

## ⚙️ **4. Logging Libraries & Practices**
- **For Java**: Log4j, SLF4J, Logback  
- **For Node.js**: Winston, Bunyan  
- **For Python**: `logging`, Loguru
