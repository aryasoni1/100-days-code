Absolutely! Here's a **comprehensive list of topics to study in Infrastructure Monitoring**, tailored for **Full-Stack Developers** and **Software Engineers (SDEs)** preparing for **FAANG-level roles**. Infrastructure monitoring is essential for understanding system health, performance, availability, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🧩 **Infrastructure Monitoring Topics for Full-Stack & SDE (FAANG Ready)**

---

### 🟢 **1. Introduction to Infrastructure Monitoring**
- **Definition**: The practice of collecting and analyzing metrics, logs, events, and traces from physical and virtual infrastructure to ensure availability and performance.
- **Why it matters**: Helps identify failures, bottlenecks, or anomalies in production systems before they impact users.

---

### 🔧 **2. Types of Infrastructure Monitoring**
- **System Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage.
- **Application Monitoring**: App performance, uptime, API latency.
- **Network Monitoring**: Bandwidth, connectivity, packet loss.
- **Cloud Monitoring**: AWS, Azure, GCP services (e.g., EC2, RDS, Lambda).
- **Container Monitoring**: Kubernetes pods, Docker containers.
- **Database Monitoring**: Query performance, slow logs, connections.

---

### 📊 **3. Metrics Collection**
- **Time-series Metrics**: Data collected at regular intervals.
- **Examples**:
  - CPU Usage %
  - Memory used/free
  - Disk I/O
  - Network Throughput
  - Request rate (`req/s`)
  - Error rate (`5xx`, `4xx`)

---

### 🧠 **4. Key Monitoring Tools**
- **Prometheus**: Pull-based metrics collection.
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding.
- **Datadog**: Full-stack observability (SaaS).
- **Zabbix / Nagios**: Traditional infra monitoring tools.
- **New Relic**: APM + infrastructure.
- **Elastic Stack (ELK)**: Logging with Kibana dashboard.
- **AWS CloudWatch / Azure Monitor / GCP Operations Suite**: Cloud-native monitoring.

---

### 🔗 **5. Observability Pillars**
- **Metrics**: Quantitative data (e.g., CPU load).
- **Logs**: Text-based logs from apps or systems.
- **Traces**: Track request flow across microservices.
- **Events**: Discrete system-level occurrences (e.g., deployments, failures).

---

### ⚙️ **6. Exporters and Agents**
- **Node Exporter**: For Linux system metrics (Prometheus).
- **cAdvisor**: Container resource usage.
- **Fluentd / Filebeat**: For log shipping.
- **Telegraf**: Agent for collecting and reporting metrics.

---

### 🔔 **7. Alerting Systems**
- **Alertmanager (Prometheus)**: Rule-based alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
- **Threshold-based Alerts**: Triggered when a metric exceeds a set value.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Alerts on deviations from baseline.
- **SLO/SLI Alerts**: Alert when Service Level Indicators breach thresholds.

---

### 🗂 **8. Dashboards and Visualization**
- Use tools like **Grafana**, **Kibana**, or **Datadog Dashboards** to:
  - Display live CPU/Memory/Network usage
  - Monitor deployments, incidents, trends
  - Correlate system metrics with business KPIs

---

### 🔐 **9. Infrastructure Security Monitoring**
- **Host Intrusion Detection** (e.g., OSSEC, Falco).
- **Audit Logs**: Track access, changes.
- **Vulnerability Scanning** (e.g., Nessus).
- **IAM Metrics**: Unusual logins or permissions.

---

### ☁️ **10. Cloud-Native Monitoring**
- **Kubernetes Monitoring**:
  - Pod health, resource requests/limits
  - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling metrics
- **Serverless Monitoring**:
  - Lambda cold starts, invocation errors
- **Managed Services Monitoring**:
  - RDS/Cloud SQL performance
  - Load Balancer health checks

---

### 📦 **11. Monitoring Best Practices**
- Define **SLOs (Service Level Objectives)** and **SLIs (Indicators)**
- Reduce noise: Only alert on **actionable issues**
- Track both **system health** and **user experience**
- Use **tags/labels** for contextualized metrics (e.g., by env, service)

---

### 🧪 **12. Hands-On Projects / Practice Ideas**
- Setup **Prometheus + Grafana** to monitor your local or cloud server.
- Monitor a **Spring Boot or Node.js API** (response times, memory).
- Visualize **Docker container stats** using `cAdvisor + Prometheus`.
- Integrate **Slack/Discord Alerts** for CPU > 90% or API errors.
- Set up **log + metrics correlation** with ELK or Loki.

Would you like a **PDF checklist**, **Notion study board**, or **Docker setup files** for infrastructure monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and exporters?

Absolutely! Here's a **comprehensive list of topics to study in Prometheus and Grafana**, tailored for **Full-Stack Developers** and **SDEs targeting FAANG-level roles**, with brief definitions and explanations. Monitoring and observability are crucial for production systems, performance tuning, and incident response — all of which are key at FAANG scale.

## 📊 Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring Roadmap (for Full-Stack & SDE Roles)

---

### 🟢 **PROMETHEUS TOPICS**

Prometheus is an open-source **metrics-based monitoring** and **alerting toolkit** optimized for time-series data.

---

### 🔹 1. **Prometheus Architecture**
- **Components**: Prometheus Server, Exporters, Pushgateway, Alertmanager.
- **Pull Model**: Prometheus **scrapes targets** on intervals instead of receiving pushed data.

---

### 🔹 2. **Metrics Types**
- **Counter**: Monotonic value (e.g., requests processed).
- **Gauge**: Arbitrary value that can go up/down (e.g., memory usage).
- **Histogram**: Distribution of values over intervals.
- **Summary**: Percentiles over a sliding window.

---

### 🔹 3. **Prometheus Data Model**
- **Time-Series DB** with labels and values:
  - e.g., `http_requests_total{method="POST", handler="/api"}`

---

### 🔹 4. **PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)**
- Used to query, filter, and aggregate time-series data.
- Examples:
  - `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`
  - `avg_over_time(cpu_usage[1h])`

---

### 🔹 5. **Exporters**
- **Expose metrics from services** (Node, DBs, etc.).
- Common:
  - **Node Exporter** (system metrics)
  - **Blackbox Exporter** (HTTP, ICMP probes)
  - **MongoDB/MySQL Exporters**
  - **Custom Exporters** (via HTTP endpoints)

---

### 🔹 6. **Pushgateway (Optional)**
- For **short-lived batch jobs** to push metrics.
- Prometheus pulls from Pushgateway.

---

### 🔹 7. **Alertmanager**
- Sends alerts based on Prometheus rules.
- Supports routing via:
  - **Slack**
  - **Email**
  - **PagerDuty**
  - **Webhooks**

---

### 🔹 8. **Service Discovery**
- Prometheus can dynamically find targets from:
  - Kubernetes, EC2, Consul, Docker, etc.
- Great for autoscaling environments.

---

### 🔹 9. **Recording Rules**
- Precompute queries and store the result.
- Useful for reducing load on queries like:
  - `rate(requests[1m])`

---

### 🔹 10. **Retention & Storage**
- Local TSDB with retention config (`--storage.tsdb.retention.time`)
- Integration with remote storage (Cortex, Thanos)

---

---

### 🟠 **GRAFANA TOPICS**

Grafana is an open-source **visualization and analytics platform** that integrates with Prometheus (and other data sources).

---

### 🔹 1. **Grafana Architecture**
- Connects to **data sources** like Prometheus, InfluxDB, Loki, Elasticsearch.
- Offers rich **dashboards**, **alerts**, **annotations**, and plugins.

---

### 🔹 2. **Dashboard & Panels**
- Build **interactive dashboards** from metrics data.
- Common panel types:
  - Time-series graphs
  - Stat/Bar/Heatmaps
  - Tables
  - Gauge charts

---

### 🔹 3. **Data Sources**
- How Grafana queries Prometheus.
- Add Prometheus as a data source via GUI.

---

### 🔹 4. **Templating**
- Create reusable dashboards using **template variables**.
- Example: `$host`, `$env`, `$container_name`

---

### 🔹 5. **Alerting in Grafana**
- Alerting rules on visualizations (Grafana 8+ has unified alerting).
- Configure contact points (Slack, Teams, etc.).

---

### 🔹 6. **Annotations & Logs**
- Highlight events (e.g., deployments, incidents) on time-series graphs.
- Link Grafana with **Loki** to show logs in dashboards.

---

### 🔹 7. **Permissions & Folders**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for dashboards and teams.
- Organize dashboards into folders.

---

### 🔹 8. **Grafana Loki (Optional)**
- Centralized logging system designed to work with Grafana UI.
- Complements Prometheus metrics with **log insights**.
