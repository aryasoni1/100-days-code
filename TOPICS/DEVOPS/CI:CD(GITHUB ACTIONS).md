Here’s a complete list of **CI/CD topics (focusing on GitHub Actions)** that you should study as a **Fullstack Developer** and **SDE preparing for FAANG**. CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery) is critical for building scalable, testable, and automatable software systems.

---

## 🚀 CI/CD: Core Concepts

### 🔁 **1. Continuous Integration (CI)**
- Automatically run tests, builds, and checks on every code push.
- Ensures code works well before merging into the main branch.

### 📦 **2. Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)**
- **Continuous Delivery:** Automatically prepares code for release.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automatically deploys code to production after CI passes.

## 🧠 GitHub Actions Overview

### ⚙️ **3. What is GitHub Actions?**
- A CI/CD tool built into GitHub that lets you automate workflows (like testing, building, deploying).
- Uses **YAML** files (`.github/workflows/`) to define automation steps.

---

## 🛠️ GitHub Actions: Essential Topics

### 📁 **4. Workflow Files**
- **YAML Syntax** – Indentation and structure are key.
- `name:` – Give the workflow a name.
- `on:` – Define trigger events like `push`, `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`.

### 🔧 **5. Jobs and Steps**
- `jobs:` – Define units of work that run in parallel or sequentially.
- `steps:` – List of commands or actions inside a job.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

---

## 🧱 6. **Common Built-in Actions**
- `actions/checkout` – Clones your code.
- `actions/setup-node` – Sets up Node.js environment.
- `actions/setup-java` – For Java or Spring Boot.
- `run:` – Execute shell commands directly.

---

## 🎯 7. **Trigger Events**
- `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, `release`, `workflow_dispatch` (manual).
- Filter branches/tags:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
```

---

## 🔄 8. **Environment Setup**
- Define OS (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`).
- Use environment variables (`env:` or `secrets:`).

---

## 🧪 9. **Testing**
- Run test suites automatically:
  - **JavaScript**: `npm test`
  - **Java**: `mvn test` or `gradle test`
  - **Python**: `pytest`
- Add test coverage reports or lint checks.

---

## ⚙️ 10. **Build and Deploy**
- **Build Frontend**: `npm run build`
- **Build Backend**: `mvn package`, `docker build`, etc.
- **Deploy** to:
  - Vercel/Netlify (via GitHub integration)
  - Firebase
  - AWS/GCP via CLI or Actions
  - GitHub Pages (`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`)

---

## 🔐 11. **Secrets and Security**
- Use GitHub Secrets (`Settings > Secrets`) to store tokens, API keys.
- Reference them like `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}`.

---

## 🧹 12. **Matrix Strategy (Parallel Builds)**
- Test across multiple Node.js/Java/Python versions:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [14, 16, 18]
```

---

## 📈 13. **Artifacts & Caching**
- `actions/upload-artifact`: Store build/test results.
- `actions/cache`: Speed up builds by caching dependencies (e.g., `node_modules`, `.m2`).

---

## 🔁 14. **Reusable Workflows & Composite Actions**
- Define reusable workflows and reference them using `workflow_call`.
- Use `composite` actions to create your own GitHub Actions.

---

## 📋 15. **Notifications and Monitoring**
- Integrate with Slack, Discord, or email for status updates.
- Use `if:` conditionals to trigger steps selectively.

---

## 💡 Bonus Tips
- Add **status badges** to your `README.md` to show workflow status.
- Use **manual triggers** (`workflow_dispatch`) for controlled deployments.
- Keep your CI/CD fast — only run what’s necessary for the job.
