Here’s a comprehensive list of **Git (Version Control) topics** you should study as a **Fullstack Developer** and **SDE aiming for FAANG**. Git is an essential tool for collaboration, code management, and deployment in real-world software engineering.

---

## 🧠 1. **Introduction to Git & Version Control**
- **What is Git?**  
  A distributed version control system that tracks code changes, allows collaboration, and helps manage different versions of a project.
  
- **Git vs GitHub**  
  Git is the tool; GitHub is a platform for hosting and managing Git repositories online.

---

## 🗂️ 2. **Git Basics**
- `git init` – Initialize a new local Git repository.  
- `git clone <repo-url>` – Copy an existing remote repo to your machine.  
- `git status` – View the current state of your working directory.  
- `git add <file>` – Stage file changes for commit.  
- `git commit -m "message"` – Save the staged changes with a message.  
- `git log` – View the commit history.  
- `git diff` – See differences between changes.

---

## 🌲 3. **Branching and Merging**
- **Branches** allow multiple lines of development.
  - `git branch <name>` – Create a branch.  
  - `git checkout <branch>` – Switch branches.  
  - `git checkout -b <branch>` – Create and switch.

- **Merging**
  - `git merge <branch>` – Combine another branch into your current one.  
  - Merge Conflicts – Occur when both branches modify the same part of a file; must be resolved manually.

---

## 🌐 4. **Working with Remote Repositories**
- `git remote -v` – View remote repos.  
- `git push origin <branch>` – Push commits to the remote repo.  
- `git pull origin <branch>` – Fetch and merge from remote.  
- `git fetch` – Only downloads changes; does not merge.

---

## 💻 5. **Rebasing and History Rewriting**
- `git rebase <branch>` – Move commits from one branch to another to maintain a clean history.  
- `git cherry-pick <commit>` – Apply a specific commit to the current branch.  
- `git reset` – Undo commits:
  - `--soft`: keep changes staged.  
  - `--mixed`: keep changes unstaged.  
  - `--hard`: delete changes permanently.

- `git revert <commit>` – Create a new commit that undoes the effects of a previous one (safer than reset).

---

## 📦 6. **Stashing and Cleaning**
- `git stash` – Save unfinished work temporarily without committing.  
- `git stash pop` – Restore the stashed work.  
- `git clean -f` – Remove untracked files.

---

## 🔎 7. **Inspecting & Debugging**
- `git blame <file>` – See who changed each line.  
- `git show <commit>` – Show changes from a specific commit.  
- `git bisect` – Find the commit that introduced a bug.

---

## 🔄 8. **Collaboration Workflows**
- **Git Flow / Feature Branch Workflow**
  - `main`: stable production branch.  
  - `dev`: integration branch.  
  - `feature/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`: topic branches.

- **Fork & Pull Request Model**  
  Used heavily in open-source and large teams (e.g., GitHub contributions).

---

## 🛠️ 9. **.gitignore & Config**
- `.gitignore` – Files and directories Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).  
- `git config` – Set user info, aliases, editor preferences.

---

## 🧪 10. **Advanced Git**
- **Submodules** – Include one repo inside another.  
- **Hooks** – Scripts that run before/after Git commands (used for linting, pre-commit checks).  
- **Tagging** – Mark specific points (e.g., versions): `git tag v1.0`.

---

## ✅ Bonus Tips
- Learn how to **resolve merge conflicts** calmly and cleanly.  
- Practice with **real-world team collaboration** on GitHub/GitLab.  
- Use **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation (testing, building, deploying).
